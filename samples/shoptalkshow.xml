<h3>Q &amp; A</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="#t=3:07">3:07</a></strong> What is up with styling checkboxes? I had never had to do it before and it surprised me just how hard it is. Why haven&#8217;t browsers fixed this?</li>
<li><strong><a href="#t=11:35">11:35</a></strong> Viaduct is very similar to Heroku, but allows users to deploy their Rails applications, in addition to applications built in PHP MVC frameworks (CakePHP, Laravel, etc) – it even does WordPress sites.</li>
<li><strong><a href="#t=14:28">14:28</a></strong> I thought I would send you <a href="https://gist.github.com/wesleytodd/9252276">this example</a> from some of the sass we have at work. It uses a list and a few functions to dynamically create all the helpers for an icon font.</li>
<li><strong><a href="#t=16:50">16:50</a></strong> Any advice for a Mac newbie on what to install on my first day, so I&#8217;m not flailing around like a lunatic for the first few hours?</li>
<li><strong><a href="#t=20:34">20:34</a></strong> I&#8217;ve been thinking on moving from <a href="https://netbeans.org/downloads/">Netbeans IDE</a> to <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime text</a>, but then found only one extension (<a href="https://github.com/martomo/SublimeTextXdebug">SublimeXdebug</a>) which seems partial and rarely updated. Do you know of any other alternative for PHP debugging on Sublime text?</li>
<li><strong><a href="#t=29:25">29:25</a></strong> A new Israeli law requires all websites to be accessible (at AA level). The law states that &#8220;Website administrators who fail to comply could face fines of up to 50,000 shekels (~14,000$)&#8221;. I was wondering if similar accessibility laws exist in the U.S. or other western countries?</li>
<li><strong><a href="#t=42:00">42:00</a></strong> I am getting a low score on <a href="https://gtmetrix.com">GTmetrix</a> for serving larger images than the boxes they are intended for on my website, all of that because I’m trying to think about users with large resolution screens. These online tests such as gtmetrix or even Google Page Speed test are making me give users worse experience.</li>
<li><strong><a href="#t=49:30">49:30</a></strong> How do you go about doing local development using MAMP and testing responsive sites on your local machine from other devices (phones / tablets) in your local area network?</li>
<li><strong><a href="#t=54:45">54:45</a></strong> I keep stumbling on a lot of other web servers like Puma and Unicorn and was wondering if these were worth looking into?</li>

Q &#38; A

3:07 What is up with styling checkboxes? I had never had to do it before and it surprised me just how hard it is. Why haven&#8217;t browsers fixed this?
11:35 Viaduct is very similar to Heroku, but allows users to deploy their Rails applications, in addition to applications built in PHP MVC frameworks (CakePHP, Laravel, etc) – it even does WordPress sites.
14:28 I thought I would send you this example from some of the sass we have at work. It uses a list and a few functions to dynamically create all the helpers for an icon font.

<h3>Q &amp; A</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="#t=40:20">40:20</a></strong> How come we haven&#8217;t figured out a way to animate phone app icons on events like &#8220;when clicked&#8221; or moved?</li>
<li><strong><a href="#t=45:01">45:01</a></strong> When did Front-End become closer to &#8220;Back End&#8221;? Do you think staying on the path as a UI Engineer is smart or trying to pivot and learn more of the JS frameworks, etc.?</li>
<li><strong><a href="#t=50:00">50:00</a></strong> What are some useful ways I can stay on top of whats new and changing other then listening to Shoptalk Show?</li>

		<itunes:summary>Hear the finale of the #DaveGoesWindows series. Worried about being left behind? What can you do while you just build websites? The line between front end and back end developers being blurred? Animating icons on your phone&#8217;s home screen? We&#8217;ve got answers!
Q &#38; A

40:20 How come we haven&#8217;t figured out a way to animate phone app icons on events like &#8220;when clicked&#8221; or moved?
45:01 When did Front-End become closer to &#8220;Back End&#8221;? Do you think staying on the path as a UI Engineer is smart or trying to pivot and learn more of the JS frameworks, etc.?
50:00 What are some useful ways I can stay on top of whats new and changing other then listening to Shoptalk Show?

<li><strong><a href="#t=22:40">22:40</a></strong> Listening to the newest episode, and you&#8217;re mentioning how you&#8217;re about to move to PHP7 and HTTP/2. I recently did this. PHP7 was fine. I had issues with moving to HTTP/2, however. I was receiving the dreaded &#8216;ERR_SPDY_PROTOCOL_ERROR&#8217; on secondary pages.</li>
<li><strong><a href="#t=30:50">30:50</a></strong> Modern tools provide much more power over the application state, file size and whatnot, but it&#8217;s taking me insanely long to build the simplest things. Is frontend development currently in a bad state or am I just projecting?</li>
<li><strong><a href="#t=39:40">39:40</a></strong> In your work and opinion, is a sub-module file something that you&#8217;d create once the module got too big, or as soon as there&#8217;s a major variation to the module? Or another way?</li>
<li><strong><a href="#t=46:45">46:45</a></strong> Apparently, some people are buying lists of numbers and running them through our website to see if they run across any valid numbers. This is then blowing up our email with notifications from Authorize.net. What to do about the scammers?</li>
<li><strong><a href="#t=52:55">52:55</a></strong> Just letting you guys know that 50 000 links is the limit <em>per</em> sitemap. However, there’s a thing called a sitemap index file which holds links to individual sitemaps which then have a limit of 50 000 links.</li>
<li><strong><a href="#t=56:40">56:40</a></strong> Do you know if any web bots are crawling/indexing js / mustache.js on the fly? Or is there no answer for mustache SEO yet?</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s time for a RAPIDFire Episode: Optimize for Beer 30. We blast through your questions such as using web-based push notifications, saving a stash of code to start projects, how to prep for a dev interview, printing page numbers via CSS, WordPress and jQuery, are conferences worth it, minify vs non-minified, and Bootstrap&#8217;s CSS utilities.</p>
<h3>Q &amp; A</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="#t=3:03">3:03</a></strong> With mobile web design on the rise, what are yall&#8217;s takes on web-based push notifications?</li>
<li><strong><a href="#t=10:20">10:20</a></strong> Are there things you HAVE to have (framework or things such as normalize etc) at the start of each project? Or do you reach to your own stash of code?</li>
<li><strong><a href="#t=17:57">17:57</a></strong> Could you please run through the types of questions and tests that come up in dev interviews?</li>
<li><strong><a href="#t=24:50">24:50</a></strong> I know it&#8217;s best practise for performance to do one DOM lookup per element, then save it as a variable for future reference. How would you handle this using ES6 modules?</li>
<li><strong><a href="#t=30:55">30:55</a></strong> What do you use for cross browser css print page numbers? It seems like each browser has their own idea, in 2016 why cant the recognize the need for printing from the web and create a standard?</li>
<li><strong><a href="#t=35:09">35:09</a></strong> Is there a reason why WordPress doesn&#8217;t move jQuery and jQuery migrate to the footer by default? Is there a way to do this without decoupling the included jQuery / migrate version that comes with WordPress?</li>
<li><strong><a href="#t=38:07">38:07</a></strong> As a newbie and freelancer should I be going to conferences regularly? Or are they more for &#8220;experts&#8221;? Concerning the costs, are conferences something that could be considered a tax write off?</li>
<li><strong><a href="#t=45:00">45:00</a></strong> Clearly the benefits of concatenation are huge, but is the loss of CSS line numbers really worth saving 2 KB for on an average website that is being QA&#8217;d every day? What are your thoughts?</li>
<li><strong><a href="#t=50:50">50:50</a></strong> Is it bad practice to use bootstrap&#8217;s or other CSS library&#8217;s &#8216;hidden-md&#8217;, &#8216;hidden-sm&#8217; and &#8216;hidden-xs&#8217; to make responsive layouts?</li>

		<itunes:summary>It&#8217;s time for a RAPIDFire Episode: Optimize for Beer 30. We blast through your questions such as using web-based push notifications, saving a stash of code to start projects, how to prep for a dev interview, printing page numbers via CSS, WordPress and jQuery, are conferences worth it, minify vs non-minified, and Bootstrap&#8217;s CSS utilities.
Q &#38; A

3:03 With mobile web design on the rise, what are yall&#8217;s takes on web-based push notifications?
10:20 Are there things you HAVE to have (framework or things such as normalize etc) at the start of each project? Or do you reach to your own stash of code?
17:57 Could you please run through the types of questions and tests that come up in dev interviews?
24:50 I know it&#8217;s best practise for performance to do one DOM lookup per element, then save it as a variable for future reference. How would you handle this using ES6 modules?
30:55 What do you use for cross browser css print page numbers? It seems like each browser has their own idea, in 2016 why cant the recognize the need for printing from the web and create a standard?
35:09 Is there a reason why WordPress doesn&#8217;t move jQuery and jQuery migrate to the footer by default? Is there a way to do this without decoupling the included jQuery / migrate version that comes with WordPress?
38:07 As a newbie and freelancer should I be going to conferences regularly? Or are they more for &#8220;experts&#8221;? Concerning the costs, are conferences something that could be considered a tax write off?
45:00 Clearly the benefits of concatenation are huge, but is the loss of CSS line numbers really worth saving 2 KB for on an average website that is being QA&#8217;d every day? What are your thoughts?
50:50 Is it bad practice to use bootstrap&#8217;s or other CSS library&#8217;s &#8216;hidden-md&#8217;, &#8216;hidden-sm&#8217; and &#8216;hidden-xs&#8217; to make responsive layouts?

<li><strong><a href="#t=12:54">12:54</a></strong> My question for you is EMS vs REMS which one should I be using?</li>
<li><strong><a href="#t=17:10">17:10</a></strong> What&#8217;s the current best practices and thinking behind inlining CSS and JavaScript for single page sites (SPAs)? The goal would be to minimize http requests and have the page ultimately load faster.</li>
<li><strong><a href="#t=21:30">21:30</a></strong> I am a big fan of static site generators. I have been hearing a lot about them. I have heard less, however, about flat-file CMS&#8217;s, but am curious about them. Have you tried any of them? What did you think?</li>
<li><strong><a href="#t=28:25">28:25</a></strong> What are some services you recommend for online forms? Is there a better WordPress plugin? Or maybe a third party service that is easy to integrate?</li>
<li><strong><a href="#t=31:33">31:33</a></strong> When should you delete git branches. Should you delete them right after the change/fix/added feature is merged with master?</li>
<li><strong><a href="#t=35:40">35:40</a></strong> Is it a bad idea to add direct descendant selectors (>) when they are not needed?</li>

<li><strong><a href="#t=46:35">46:35</a></strong> I am trying to target my links in my CSS but they are being overridden by a User Agent Stylesheet. Any advice and info would be much appreciated.</li>
<li><strong><a href="#t=52:25">52:25</a></strong> Back when I used icon fonts, I could easily use icons in CSS in something like a ::before element simply by setting the font-family to the icon font and pasting the unicode icon in content:””. Is there a way to use these SVGs icons like that?</li>

18:20 I was wondering what your specific thoughts were on MongoDB.
29:40 We&#8217;ve recently embarked on a department restructure, but the problem is we can&#8217;t settle on a name that reflects what our team offers, or whether we should even remain one department. Do you have any experience with this type of challenge, or any thoughts on how we can manage it as strategically as possible?
36:00 My question is when to use flex box vs the new specification CSS grid layout?
39:20 Say you spent 20 hours doing much needed refactoring — How do you prevent your client from having a heart attack after presenting so many hours of no visible results? Do you educate them about technical debt and charge them in full, or do you subtract an arbitrary amount of hours?

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>RAPIDFIRE #57! !pew! !pew! 15 minutes on Favicon issues &#8211; need we say more? Ok how about versioning a major website rewrite? Developing an idea for a talk? Arguments about AMP? Front end devs feeling like back end devs? WordPress and WooCommerce issues? !pew! !pew!</p>
<h3>Q &amp; A</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=2:46">2:46</a> What is the impact on performance when including all favicons? What is current best practice?</li>
<li><a href="#t=17:23">17:23</a> I have a question on website versioning, say you have v1 of a site under source control and want to rewrite that site. Would you create a new repo for the rewrite or somehow tag the current as v1 and add the files for v2?</li>
<li><a href="#t=22:30">22:30</a>  I would love to speak to people but am having a hard time figuring out what would be a good topic to pitch; I’m afraid I am just re-interpreting previous ideas/talks.</li>
<li><a href="#t=32:00">32:00</a> Is there a plugin or a setting to load images before the WooCommerce JS plugin?</li>

		<itunes:summary>RAPIDFIRE #57! !pew! !pew! 15 minutes on Favicon issues &#8211; need we say more? Ok how about versioning a major website rewrite? Developing an idea for a talk? Arguments about AMP? Front end devs feeling like back end devs? WordPress and WooCommerce issues? !pew! !pew!
Q &#38; A

2:46 What is the impact on performance when including all favicons? What is current best practice?
17:23 I have a question on website versioning, say you have v1 of a site under source control and want to rewrite that site. Would you create a new repo for the rewrite or somehow tag the current as v1 and add the files for v2?
22:30  I would love to speak to people but am having a hard time figuring out what would be a good topic to pitch; I’m afraid I am just re-interpreting previous ideas/talks.
32:00 Is there a plugin or a setting to load images before the WooCommerce JS plugin?
37:55 What are your feelings about AMP pages? Do you think AMP pages will have “staying power”?
48:36 I was hired as a front end dev but based on the amount of php I’m writing these days, I’m starting to feel like a back end dev. What’s the line between front end dev and back end dev?
54:05 Do you think tacking on additional items to the WordPress post object is a good idea or a bad idea?

Q &#38; A

3:20 What should a web developer do when handed off prototype builds of HTML/CSS/JS? 
8:00 Do you guys know of a better way to handle the distribution of our JS for this website?
11:50 I’m a novice web designer. I have a site where I’ve made many changes/additions. I want to start fresh because I don’t know what ID’s, Class, script etc is used and what is not. What is the best way to start fresh!
19:58 This is a question for everyone &#8211; just wanted to see if you guys have any general tips/recommendations for a SXSW first-timer?
25:20 I’ve been looking for an html5 / css3 / grid-like boilerplate that uses ems instead of pixels. Do any exist? Can you recommend one?
31:00 Online IDEs vs. Local Development?
38:30 This has to do with the HTML5 section tag. The W3C says that it is a generic element tag, but not a generic wrapper. Will the W3C kill a puppy every time I add a background color to a section?
44:30  I would like to know if you can style the HTML5 input “Range” slider to have one color for the portion that indicates the current value (the used portion of the slider) and another color for the portion indicating you will increase the value.

		<itunes:summary>This week we have another RAPIDFire episode digging way back into the question archive to answer questions about stolen SVGs, getting started writing for the web, dealing with small styles, the best library for DOM manipulation, and Dropbox Driven Development.
Q &#38; A

2:00 What could I do to make them understand that the web is moving forward, and their websites should too? I know the websites I make is for them and not for me, but it feels a bit strange.
5:30 Given that SVG files are the raw and un-rendered, it’s much easier to take bits of pieces of it versus a PNG image. Are you ever worried that someone will come along and steal parts of the SVG file?
9:10 Do you know any other way to concatenate javascript while keeping the list of js paths out of the gulp file?
12:50 Sometimes I run into problems with how I have wrote the html or css in a way that makes it hard to position a div or tab. What are some best practices when coding the html and css so that the page comes together in an efficient and predictable manner?
15:28 The web world has so much going on and our industry has so many amazing writers, how does one find a way to write something different? Is it even worth worrying about?
19:50 I am facing a problem where I don’t have enough clients. How do I get more of them? I don’t live in an area with many businesses that I can work for. And how can I write a good proposal? Tips and experience?
25:56 How do you handle small styles for example three lines of code in sass do you create its own partials or create one called global and put it in there?
29:55 I find CSS modularization very intriguing but would like to view great examples of projects implementing style builds entirely in JS. Could you point me to some good open source examples?
37:00 Is jQuery still the best library for DOM manipulation?
42:47 Is there a workflow or tools you would recommend for automated pre-commit code formatting? So that everyone who contributes code has it automatically formatted the same without having to worry about editorconfig. We use css, js, and handlebars templates.
46:40 I know the obvious answer is for everyone to work strictly locally and then use Git when work is ready, but what is the best way to handle this when working with partials? Should we compile on the server? Or separate our project out into a ‘development’ and ‘distribution’ structure with a build task?
50:47 Do you guys have any suggestions on software options to provide monthly search engine ranking reports that can help automate this process. I’m building up a decent client base and would love to save some time with researching the hundreds of keywords I’m currently tracking. Thanks!

<ul>
<li><a href="#t=51:47">51:47</a> Where I live there aren’t many local jobs for me. The local jobs are mostly unrelated to my skill set and aren’t things I’m interested in, and the remote jobs tend to be geared towards those with many years of experience and better developed soft-skills. Am I, or anyone else in a similar situation to mine, outa luck? Or is there a plausible escape plan?</li>

This week we talk with Monika Piotrowicz and Lara Hogan about career paths &#8211; where we started from doesn&#8217;t always equal where we&#8217;ve landed. Freelancer? Go to university or college? Find a mentor? It&#8217;s a common ShopTalk Show question and we do our best to answer from our experiences.
Q &#38; A

51:47 Where I live there aren’t many local jobs for me. The local jobs are mostly unrelated to my skill set and aren’t things I’m interested in, and the remote jobs tend to be geared towards those with many years of experience and better developed soft-skills. Am I, or anyone else in a similar situation to mine, outa luck? Or is there a plausible escape plan?

<li><a href="#t=19:31">19:31</a> When using a grid system, is it better to separate the layout classes from the element you wish to style, or combine them to save on markup?</li>

<li><a href="#t=30:00">30:00</a> Why does Chris end each show in a monotone voice?</li>
<li><a href="#t=31:31">31:31</a> What are some of the ways we can support, apply, and encourage empathy in our relatively young community? What are the biggest issues we can focus on fixing as a community?</li>

<li><a href="#t=56:03">56:03</a> What are your thoughts on the increase in self-teaching among aspiring devs? Do you think this is a strength, weakness, or a bit of both, and why?</li>

<p>We take this episode to reminisce and talk about how ShopTalk Show has grown up and changed over the 199 episodes. 140 guests! 53 RAPIDFIRES! 13 Crossover Episodes!</p>
<p>There have been quite a few amazing moments. Perhaps the best of which is how many people have agreed to be on this show. In the middle of weekdays, no less!</p>
<p>From Col. W.B. Standards to Paul&#8217;s Mom. From Earl Drudge and his evil ways to faking a show from 2004 to Alex King (RIP, sir, and thanks for everything). From little shows with just Dave &amp; Chris to hundreds of people shouting &#8220;Just Build Websites!&#8221; to us on a stage. From panels full of bonafide geniuses to bookclubs to #hotdrama to Dave going Windows to bad developer jokes to endless sound effects&#8230; thanks for listening ❤️.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://bit.ly/1PLdefe">MediaTemple</a> not only for sponsoring the show, but for being our excellent web host since the beginning. We get a little nostalgic with them too, per the theme of this week&#8217;s episode. It was through Media Temple&#8217;s excellent interface that Chris first learned about web hosting and the powers we have as web designers and developers.</p>
<p>The Grid Service Media Temple offers is perhaps their most well-known, for it&#8217;s auto-scaling abilities and the fact you can host 100 sites on it. Most sites we host these days are on their Virtual Private Server hosting.</p>
<p>What you might not know (and you should!) is that Media Temple offers things like very affordable fully managed WordPress hosting, fully managed hosting on Amazon Web Services, and even fully managed dedicated servers.</p>

We take this episode to reminisce and talk about how ShopTalk Show has grown up and changed over the 199 episodes. 140 guests! 53 RAPIDFIRES! 13 Crossover Episodes!
There have been quite a few amazing moments. Perhaps the best of which is how many people have agreed to be on this show. In the middle of weekdays, no less!
From Col. W.B. Standards to Paul&#8217;s Mom. From Earl Drudge and his evil ways to faking a show from 2004 to Alex King (RIP, sir, and thanks for everything). From little shows with just Dave &#38; Chris to hundreds of people shouting &#8220;Just Build Websites!&#8221; to us on a stage. From panels full of bonafide geniuses to bookclubs to #hotdrama to Dave going Windows to bad developer jokes to endless sound effects&#8230; thanks for listening ❤️.

Braintree 30:00
Developers around the world have embraced the Braintree v­dot­zero SDK as the easiest way to add secure mobile payments to their apps and websites.
No matter what payment type, Braintree accepts it. Apple Pay, Android Pay, PayPal, Venom, credit cards, even Bitcoin. And if something new pops up, Braintree will support that too. It’s the same payment solution used by Uber, Airbnb, and GitHub, so you know it scales.
Integrating it into your app is as easy as inserting a few lines of code. Try out the sandbox and see for yourself.
MediaTemple 54:00
Thanks to MediaTemple not only for sponsoring the show, but for being our excellent web host since the beginning. We get a little nostalgic with them too, per the theme of this week&#8217;s episode. It was through Media Temple&#8217;s excellent interface that Chris first learned about web hosting and the powers we have as web designers and developers.
The Grid Service Media Temple offers is perhaps their most well-known, for it&#8217;s auto-scaling abilities and the fact you can host 100 sites on it. Most sites we host these days are on their Virtual Private Server hosting.
What you might not know (and you should!) is that Media Temple offers things like very affordable fully managed WordPress hosting, fully managed hosting on Amazon Web Services, and even fully managed dedicated servers.</itunes:summary>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>Stacy Kvernmo, Senior UX Designer at <a href="http://collegiseducation.com">Collegis Education</a>, is on the show to help us answer questions about lazy loading, fine-tuning WordPress&#8217; dashboard, starter themes for WordPress, ways to work more efficiently, and how to handle tough work situations while trying to build websites.</p>
<h3>Q &amp; A</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=27:00">27:00</a> I work in a shop where widows and orphans are despised. I can dig it. It looks a little better to have a few more words wrap to the next line. Generally in this case I am asked to code a line break for mobile so I will put in a br with media query rules applied. </li>
<li><a href="#t=31:10">31:10</a> What are some lazy loading best practices?</li>
<li><a href="#t=36:08">36:08</a> Do you have  tried and true plugins or different strategies for fine-tuning the WordPress dashboard?</li>
<li><a href="#t=43:17">43:17</a> I am looking for a new starting point to build my sites on. I think I am not skilled enough to roll my own theme and build everything from the ground up. I have use roots.io in the past, but this has grown to something that I don’t understand anymore. I know there are a few frameworks out there, but what do you guys recommend?</li>
<li><a href="#t=51:20">51:20</a> I often find myself fussing over small design details, refactoring code (to do things the &#8220;right&#8221; way), or just spending too long trying to figure something out. Do you have any tips for working more effectively and efficiently?</li>
<li><a href="#t=56:50">56:50</a> I try to teach and explain why certain designs will not work on the web, but if it doesn’t look exactly the same as on his/her Apple Retina Cinema display on Safari then it’s wrong. It drive me mad that I can’t have a good working relationship and work together to build awesome websites. Can you give any advice from previous experiences on how you would approach this situation?</li>

Stacy Kvernmo, Senior UX Designer at Collegis Education, is on the show to help us answer questions about lazy loading, fine-tuning WordPress&#8217; dashboard, starter themes for WordPress, ways to work more efficiently, and how to handle tough work situations while trying to build websites.
Q &#38; A

27:00 I work in a shop where widows and orphans are despised. I can dig it. It looks a little better to have a few more words wrap to the next line. Generally in this case I am asked to code a line break for mobile so I will put in a br with media query rules applied. 
31:10 What are some lazy loading best practices?
36:08 Do you have  tried and true plugins or different strategies for fine-tuning the WordPress dashboard?
43:17 I am looking for a new starting point to build my sites on. I think I am not skilled enough to roll my own theme and build everything from the ground up. I have use roots.io in the past, but this has grown to something that I don’t understand anymore. I know there are a few frameworks out there, but what do you guys recommend?
51:20 I often find myself fussing over small design details, refactoring code (to do things the &#8220;right&#8221; way), or just spending too long trying to figure something out. Do you have any tips for working more effectively and efficiently?
56:50 I try to teach and explain why certain designs will not work on the web, but if it doesn’t look exactly the same as on his/her Apple Retina Cinema display on Safari then it’s wrong. It drive me mad that I can’t have a good working relationship and work together to build awesome websites. Can you give any advice from previous experiences on how you would approach this situation?

<p>Drew McLellan is on this week to talk about Perch &#8211; the CMS built for web professionals &#8211; and the upcoming 24Ways.</p>

<li><a href="#t=30:40">30:40</a> What was the hardest thing about turning Perch into a steady income stream, what you did to overcome it and what tips would you have for someone that wants to start a side project, but doesn’t even have an idea yet?</li>
<li><a href="#t=35:10">35:10</a> As an agency, a lot of our sites are too image heavy and it is hurting performance for mobile. What is the best practice for responsive images as content (not background images)?</li>
<li><a href="#t=39:00">39:00</a> Picture having to format every single page, paragraph, roll over, drop down, chart, graph; basically anything with text as a separate PSD file/layer comp. Am I alone thinking that this method of content development insane? Or, is this a lot more common than I think?</li>
<li><a href="#t=45:50">45:50</a> I’m looking to catch up with the times and use Github in my workflow for client projects, but I don’t really know how I should actually use it. Like should I create a separate repo for each client? Or should I make one repo and have multiple folders or branches, since Github only allows a set amount of private repos?</li>
<li><a href="#t=55:28">55:28</a> I am a developer for a site with a community of 200 000+ users. We have decided that we want to migrate to a sparkly new modern system! What software/system should we migrate to?</li>

26:18 I don’t want to work with advertisement for the rest of my life, so I still want to build my web-development skill-set. Moreover, I like it. I want to be a web-developer. So what to you guys think I should do?
30:42Do you guys know of ways that older developers looking to move into a new technology can get mentoring on this new technology, besides Googling like a madman?
40:34 I’ve been a web designer for a while, and have always wanted to use it. Do you have any tips on becoming a Freelance Designer?

<p>RAPIDFIRE 53 &lt;pew!>&lt;pew!> Sass on remote servers, Dave&#8217;s rysnc workflow, styling tooltips, leveling up as quick as Dave and Chris, archiving annual sites, poor performance with JS, minimizing requests in WordPress, modernizing legacy CSS, SEO, and more!</p>
<h3>Q &amp; A</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=3:40">3:40</a> I’ve never considered running Sass on the remote server &#8211; but is this the optimal way to go about it? Do people really process their Sass files on the remote server? What are the pros and cons of this workflow?</li>
<li><a href="#t=12:20">12:20</a> I was interested in hearing more about Dave’s rsync workflow to deploy his site.</li>
<li><a href="#t=17:20">17:20</a> What is the best way of styling tooltips? Google doesn’t come up with much. Have things moved on at all since the last CSS Tricks article about it in 2011? It seems very complicated for a much needed and simple effect.</li>
<li><a href="#t=23:24">23:24</a> How do you guys seem to level up so quickly? I have been focused on learning JavaScript, jQuery, and PHP for a while now and, for whatever reason, I cannot get to that next level of understanding.</li>
<li><a href="#t=28:55">28:55</a> I work at a public library where we help put on an annual event that runs for a few months. Each year the event has a different theme. The site gets a few thousand visits during the course the event, so I’m weighing how much time/effort I should really put into this.</li>
<li><a href="#t=34:38">34:38</a> I have some JS running on a page every 300ms to do&#8230;stuff. I’m worried that it’s going to result in some kind of poor performance, but I’m not sure what to look for. <a href="http://scottfennell.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2015/10/screen.gif">Buffer Chrome Timeline</a></li>
<li><a href="#t=38:13">38:13</a> I’ve had a problem keeping the navigation in place when dealing with items with slightly different heights, I think this make for a better UX do you have any advice on keeping the pagination in place?</li>
<li><a href="#t=41:00">41:00</a> We use WordPress for all client sites and have pretty efficient gulp setup with sass compiling and concatenation. But as soon as you start to use a few wordpress plugins that all come with their own scripts and stylesheets the whole “Limited http requests” is out the window. Is there a way to get our theme to intercept the plugin scripts and stylesheets and combine them with my own and that way limit the amount of http requests?</li>
<li><a href="#t=43:19">43:19</a> We have a ton of legacy CSS. Is it worth the time to reverse engineer any of this to Sass? Are the CSS to Sass tools good at this? What is your experience modernizing legacy CSS?</li>
<li><a href="#t=50:48">50:48</a> How much of SEO do you take on, how much do you contract out?</li>
<li><a href="#t=58:50">58:50</a> How can I build a portfolio of websites that show that I’m a capable front-end dev when most job listings seem to have an endless list of requirements that I feel I’d never be able to encapsulate alone as one person?</li>

Q &#38; A

2:28 One thing I’m finding difficult is to be able to read other people’s code which is pretty much unavoidable.
9:53  I have a question about managing your local WordPress setup. For awhile, I have used just one WordPress install and one database and then I switch to whatever theme I am working on at the time. Do you have separate installs and databases for each project?
14:10 What is the cure for imposter syndrome?
20:45 I am enjoying my time with Atom’s text editor. But one thing that has me a little confused is adding syntax highlighting. I have read some tutorials but it seems a little complicated. I am looking to add syntax highlighting for HAML. Any advice?
27:40 Dave, what are you doing about managing file paths in your applications? Have you run into any problems with Node dependencies choking on trying to find a file using ‘/‘ instead of ‘’?
32:40 I’m the lead developer at my small shop of 14 people so I’m always trying to come up with cool ways to make the team for efficient and bring everyone’s skill up. I recently was thinking about implementing coding style guides to help unify our code.
40:00 What are you thoughts on declaring a language in an HTML document? I’m fairly new to web design and I am trying to determine how important it is. Also, where should it be declared?
45:06 Could you briefly talk about the different apps that you can use to install Sass?
49:48 I have a client that is pushing for there site to have the top scores on PageSpeed Insights. It calls the CSS BEFORE the head tag. Is this some way of improving speed or tricking Google Insights from throwing the “CSS above the Fold” issues?

		<itunes:summary>Intro
This episode we talk with Saron Yitbarek, a developer currently working at Microsft who started CodeNewbie. We discuss podcasting techniques, work/life balance, experience vs training, and RSI treatment.
Q &#38; A

23:12 How are you keeping your life balanced? What tools do you use to manage everything?
31:40 How well should you know JavaScript / JS Frameworks before you consider yourself a good front end developer? Also, at what point would you consider yourself a senior developer?
39:54 How can I get past the initial inexperience stigma? I am extremely talented straight out of college, yet it’s hard to get jobs because I have no experience.
52:13 Are there any legal ramifications for publishing a copy of another sites information online? Should I have an alert on the surge site that lets users know that this is a copy of somename.com?
54:38 I just wondered if you guys could offer any advice to people suffering from RSI or if you have had any personal experience with this (or any other type of) work based injury. 
1:03:00 Is it worth relocating to pursue a career working with a specific technology now or would it be better to wait it out until more opportunities arise?

Q &#38; A

6:53 When using static site generators like Jekyll, what are your solutions/recommendations for processing contact or project quote forms? 
15:02 I was wondering either of you have any hands-on experience with any of the new HTML5 hybrid mobile app frameworks like Ioninc, Angular Mobile, Framework7, or React/React Native?
27:50 WordPress plugins make my life easier, but I really dislike extra code being injected into my page. Where should I draw the line drawn between utilizing helpful plugins and keeping control of my code?
34:00 How do I select or deselect a div in js at mouse click event?
38:02 I work as a freelance Front-End Developer and most of my job comes from agencies outsourcing design work that needs to be coded. Is this workflow something that has taken a long time to change or am I just working with some agencies that are staying behind?
47:05 How do you guys feel about an ad agency creating and maintaining their own CMS when there are already so many high-quality solutions available?
53:08 What is the best way to test your website in different network environments? Here’s what I am doing right now: I found an app called Slowy which seems to simulate crappy mobile connections well enough. What is everybody else doing?

<li><a href="#t=2:30">2:30</a> At least twice a week, someone other than me will drop in a few lines of SCSS, compile it and we’ll end up merge-conflict town, adding a painful step in our branching process. How would you handle this? To date, my strategy has been to leave the room when anyone looks like they’re doing a merge conflict.</li>
<li><a href="#t=7:40">7:40</a> I have a website with HUNDREDS of raster images of around 15KB each. During interaction with a single page, it’s very likely that a user will need to see every one of those images. Is there a nice way of speeding up “above-the-fold” image loading other than this iterative AJAX call per page thing I’m doing? I’ve tried using compass’s sprite sheets, but the sprite file size is double that of all the images combined (maybe large color index table from disparate images?).</li>
<li><a href="#t=13:52">13:52</a> I have a brochure style site for my own business and I’ve been working on performance lately. I hooked up with grunt, started concatenating, moved my JS down and used uglification, and was ready to start separating out my above-the-fold css. It’s fun, but the optimization never ends… Then I ran into an article about <code>mod_pagespeed</code>. My hosting provider offers it and Google’s info basically says “hey optimization is tough, so let us take care of it.” So.. is <code>mod_pagespeed</code> a good idea?</li>
<li><a href="#t=21:20">21:20</a> Hey guys, I am an email developer and had a question about automation. Here is the situation, we send out several emails a week with each email containing anywhere from 25 to 70 links. We use a third party company to provide updated links to allow us to track which link is clicked. The problem is, they provide the links in an excel document, different from the brief where the original content came from. This forces me to replace each link manually, opening up large room for error and adding time to each project. Is this something Grunt or Gulp could help with?</li>
<li><a href="#t=27:10">27:10</a> A couple of factors to this question &#8211; 1) my company is moving to a new platform, so our URL structure is going to be changing once that goes live, and 2) we recently purchased a new (shorter, better) domain for our website. We are aware of the fact that you take an SEO hit when you do either of these things &#8211; so what do you think, is it better to make both of these changes at once and take one big hit, or change the domain now and update the URL structure later? We are going to be putting in 301 redirects regardless.</li>
<li><a href="#t=30:30">30:30</a> I was poking around Sara Soueidan’s code on her website and saw a bunch of stuff about DNS Prefetching. What the what?</li>
<li><a href="#t=37:55">37:55</a> I’ve been messing around with critical path CSS and getting content to my users as fast possible, which seems to mean accepting FOUT and other visual jankiness before all styles, scripts and images have loaded. It got me wondering, do I now have to choose between a site that loads super fast and a site that loads with fancy transitions and animations? Surely optimizing the critical path is all about removing anything that delays the arrival of content on the page.</li>
<li><a href="#t=44:30">44:30</a> Recently co presented on a talk about Front End Architecture at a good sized event, from the comments we DID get people wanted something much more direct, more answers. The talk was about what are the options available, and what guidelines we use to choose from them. I feel like that “well, it depends” is a recurring theme in a lot of the answers to the questions you get, because that’s the nature of the beast. Given that, and that you guys also have a lot of speaking experience… I’m curious what you guys think. Is that kind of ‘nuanced’ topic not good for ‘talks’ at events? Is that feedback from an audience inevitable and I should keep submitting talks until a cane pulls me off stage?</li>
<li><a href="#t=52:52">52:52</a> Should I get a mac?? I’ve been a windows user for 12+ years now and I just feel more comfortable using windows but I see all developer are using mac, all screencasts are on mac and a lot of the new apps are only available for mac <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> should I give up and switch to OS X?</li>

<li><a href="#t=19:15">19:15</a> What are your favourite coding application theme &amp; coding font to work with? Its early days, and I have just made the switch from Coda to Sublime.</li>
<li><a href="#t=29:10">29:10</a> I’m trying to make my workflow as modern and as sensible as possible to save me time and hassle. Using the command line is something I often hear recommended, but I’m finding it hard to find much about using it on a PC. Is this something that people do?</li>
<li><a href="#t=40:00">40:00</a> I&#8217;m wondering if creative satisfaction is more valuable than money.</li>
<li><a href="#t=48:20">48:20</a> I just discovered that Node IDEs exist, which seems a little unnecessary to me since text editors like Sublime seem to do the trick. Is it even worth looking into?</li>
<li><a href="#t=51:50">51:50</a> I’m losing a ton of sleep over the idea of making a website that makes it easier to buy assault rifle parts. How should I handle this when politically my co-workers are on the other side of the issue?</li>
<li><a href="#t=59:08">59:08</a> I was just listening to <a href="http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/173-with-andy-budd/">episode 173 with Andy Budd</a>. The three of you were going back and forth about the hypothetical inaccessible follow button. That the whole debate was centered around this assumption that JavaScript off = accessible and JavaScript on (or rather JavaScript only) = inaccessible. Is that actually true?</li>

		<itunes:summary>This week we&#8217;re joined by Wes Bos, author and web developer.
News’n’Links’n’Drama:

Nyquil

Q &#38; A:

19:15 What are your favourite coding application theme &#38; coding font to work with? Its early days, and I have just made the switch from Coda to Sublime.
29:10 I’m trying to make my workflow as modern and as sensible as possible to save me time and hassle. Using the command line is something I often hear recommended, but I’m finding it hard to find much about using it on a PC. Is this something that people do?
40:00 I&#8217;m wondering if creative satisfaction is more valuable than money.
48:20 I just discovered that Node IDEs exist, which seems a little unnecessary to me since text editors like Sublime seem to do the trick. Is it even worth looking into?
51:50 I’m losing a ton of sleep over the idea of making a website that makes it easier to buy assault rifle parts. How should I handle this when politically my co-workers are on the other side of the issue?
59:08 I was just listening to episode 173 with Andy Budd. The three of you were going back and forth about the hypothetical inaccessible follow button. That the whole debate was centered around this assumption that JavaScript off = accessible and JavaScript on (or rather JavaScript only) = inaccessible. Is that actually true?
1:04:53 Is there approach you would suggest or any books that you would recommend on problem solving or any bogs to help me please?

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve got another RAPID-FIRE for you this week! Nothing but questions and answers. That&#8217;s what you like, right? Ohhhh, yeah.</p>
<p>We answer questions about fonts on Windows PCs, CSS frameworks, carousels, organizing SASS files, deploying with rsync, unicorns, managing Gulp files, and more!</p>
<p><strong>Q &amp; A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=2:27">2:27</a> After designing and creating a website on a Mac and getting everything looking pretty, I always get a bit disappointed when I come to look at the site on a PC. I find the font smoothing and colour management on OS X make everything look substantially nicer, particularly @font-face fonts. Adding a subtle text shadow to everything helps a bit but are there any plugins or other tools to improve font smoothing on the users’ screen? If not, is there anything you take care to avoid at the design stage to make the difference less apparent in the end product?</li>
<li><a href="#t=6:30">6:30</a> I&#8217;m used to building websites from scratch, but I&#8217;m getting into HTML5 frameworks. What is the best way to customize one of those frameworks?</li>
<li><a href="#t=11:55">11:55</a> How do you feel about condensing information into swiping carousel on mobile devices? Basically, if a site has 3 columns of informational text on desktop it will turn into a 1 column carousel with swiping functionality on mobile. Some of the designers like it because it provides more interactive/fun experience on mobile, as well as helping balance and shorten the page length. I feel like this has the same principle of regular hero sized carousels and the fact no one uses them. Also, hiding content like that is just bad right?</li>
<li><a href="#t=17:35">17:35</a> So my question for you sort of open-ended, I just was hoping to get a little window into what your organization style and workflow is like with SASS. Do you keep separate stylesheets and import them all? Do you keep everything organized in one file like classic CSS? I’d just like to get some advice from someone who’s been through the ropes a little bit and can help me write code I won’t cringe at when I look back at it years from now.</li>
<li><a href="#t=21:55">21:55</a> I want to be able to select &lt;li&gt;’s like how I would files my desktop. It looked like I could use jQuery UI, but…<a href="http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5771">it doesn’t support the Shift key for multiple select</a>. Do you have any suggestions for a plugin, Code Pen (plug), etc. that could help me out?</li>
<li><a href="#t=26:04">26:04</a> I have a question about uploading a site to the web. I work locally with localhost etc, and then put my files online via FTP. I have heard you mention this is now outdated and not best practice. What are the best alternatives to FTP and what are their benefits over FTP?</li>
<li><a href="#t=29:22">29:22</a> I have always styled the default state for links using the type element selector on the anchor element like a { styles… } but I have always wondered about the pseudo-class :link since it’s function is to style links that are in its default state maybe I should just be styling using :link { styles… } instead of on the anchor element? Then I wouldn’t have conflicting styles and the need to overwrite styles when using an anchor for wrapping divs and getting rid of those link styles.</li>
<li><a href="#t=33:12">33:12</a> I graduated with a comp-sci degree but found that I love to design as well as develop on the back end. Is there anyone out there that does this? Or is there always a clear cut break between the front end and back end? Is it good to blur these lines?</li>
<li><a href="#t=36:37">36:37</a> I would like to know if there are any workarounds for pixel rounding as-well as floating point rounding in browsers? My problem occurs when I make fluid grids. All browsers seem to round floating points differently which makes them inconsistent across browsers.</li>
<li><a href="#t=40:15">40:15</a> The agency I’m working at is starting to move toward more modular SCSS, following the SMACSS model. Jonathan Snook says that media queries should go next to the module that they affect. I think this approach will be way easier to maintain, since all the code for that module will be in one spot, but I’ve also heard people mention that this will lead to massive code bloat and performance issues. Are there performance issues with this? What kind of organizational model do you all follow with your SCSS to help with maintainability?</li>
<li><a href="#t=44:46">44:46</a> I work for a small design/development agency. We are planning on redesigning our archaic website. How we build it is primarily up to me. The content will consist of media-rich case studies. It is currently on WordPress. Keeping it updated becomes so overwhelming and cumbersome that it never seems to happen. I am considering using Jekyll or perhaps some other static site compiler. Everyone in the company knows how to write markdown, and I feel that keeping the content updated via YAML or JSON would actually end up saving time. The whole site could be stored in a git repo and in my mind be much more flexible moving forward. Are there other compilers like Jekyll that I should consider? Is there anything you have found overwhelmingly difficult with this approach? Static files seem unprogressive yet in many ways they feel like a breath of fresh air.</li>
<li><a href="#t=51:01">51:01</a> What are best practices when using Gulp on a team? Should everyone always be running the latest versions of Gulp, NPM, SASS, etc? How should I deal with old Gulp files? Should I update them as I come across them, or maintain the same Gulp file across all projects? Do you have any other best practices for maintaining development environments between team members?</li>
<li><a href="#t=55:43">55:43</a> If you have a huge database driven web app, is it better to have an incomplete sitemap, or none at all? Do you see sitemaps themselves potentially becoming obsolete as search engines get smarter/better at finding their way around?</li>

Q &#38; A:

2:27 After designing and creating a website on a Mac and getting everything looking pretty, I always get a bit disappointed when I come to look at the site on a PC. I find the font smoothing and colour management on OS X make everything look substantially nicer, particularly @font-face fonts.

If not, is there anything you take care to avoid at the design stage to make the difference less apparent in the end product?
6:30 I&#8217;m used to building websites from scratch, but I&#8217;m getting into HTML5 frameworks. What is the best way to customize one of those frameworks?
11:55 How do you feel about condensing information into swiping carousel on mobile devices?

I feel like this has the same principle of regular hero sized carousels and the fact no one uses them. Also, hiding content like that is just bad right?
17:35 So my question for you sort of open-ended, I just was hoping to get a little window into what your organization style and workflow is like with SASS. Do you keep separate stylesheets and import them all? Do you keep everything organized in one file like classic CSS? I’d just like to get some advice from someone who’s been through the ropes a little bit and can help me write code I won’t cringe at when I look back at it years from now.
21:55 I want to be able to select &#60;li&#62;’s like how I would files my desktop. It looked like I could use jQuery UI, but…it doesn’t support the Shift key for multiple select. Do you have any suggestions for a plugin, Code Pen (plug), etc. that could help me out?
26:04 I have a question about uploading a site to the web. I work locally with localhost etc, and then put my files online via FTP. I have heard you mention this is now outdated and not best practice. What are the best alternatives to FTP and what are their benefits over FTP?
29:22 I have always styled the default state for links using the type element selector on the anchor element like a { styles… } but I have always wondered about the pseudo-class :link since it’s function is to style links that are in its default state maybe I should just be styling using :link { styles… } instead of on the anchor element? Then I wouldn’t have conflicting styles and the need to overwrite styles when using an anchor for wrapping divs and getting rid of those link styles.
33:12 I graduated with a comp-sci degree but found that I love to design as well as develop on the back end. Is there anyone out there that does this? Or is there always a clear cut break between the front end and back end? Is it good to blur these lines?

		<itunes:summary>We&#8217;ve got another RAPID-FIRE for you this week! Pew Pew Pew, Kaboom!
We answer questions about managing SVG files, Ruby on Rails vs PHP, jQuery&#8217;s new CSS framework, apps we&#8217;re thankful for, Image Source Set, style guides, and vacations.
Q &#38; A:

1:59 How do you deal with minified SVGs with git? Do you commit the minified SVGs or keep the originals around? Do you put the minified files in a different location (i.e., build directory)? Do you copy the other images (PNGs, JPGs, etc) to that directory as well?
9:44 Why are so many web apps build with Ruby on Rails? What are the benefits over a PHP framework like CodeIgniter? What makes you sacrifice the simplicity and performance of PHP?
20:13 What do you think about jQuery’s new CSS framework? They seem to have big plans.
28:27 What software, app, repo, blog, website, or whatever would you thank the developers / designers for, and why? Maybe your listeners can take 2 minutes to tweet or email to let some lone devs or designers know they’re doing good, and maybe a whole load of people can have a better day today.
35:00 I know a lot has been done to get image src set, and I appreciate it. However, I am a bit worried it might have been wasted time. How can I decide what image size to serve when I have no clue about my user’s Internet speed or data plan? Perhaps the best option is to serve the best compromise and give users the option to access a bigger image. Are the good old CSS background image and media queries enough?
42:27 What&#8217;s the best way to deal with SVG icons? Is it best to put them inline or add them within the CSS as background-image url? What&#8217;s the best way to deal with different changes on hover (such as color changes)?
50:21 I’m working on a redesign for an old website. Should I begin by creating a style guide and then using it as a reference for myself or is the style guide born out of my redesign?

<ul>
<li><a href="#t=47:57">47:57</a> I am the team leader for the front-end team. I have some great developers that work with me, but sometimes I have a hard time conveying the fact that sometimes we have to do stuff on our websites that we don&#8217;t like to please the client. For example, the classic example where a client that wants to make sure everything works in IE9. How can I help my developers understand that we have to slowly educate the client, but in the end the client writes the check?</li>
<li><a href="#t=56:27">56:27</a> I have two questions for you. I was recently let go from an enterprise-level company and was not given a reason why. It took me by surprise and I’ve not been able to get an explanation despite asking multiple times and from different people in the organization. I’m having trouble finding the words to explain why I was let go to potential employers. Any advice as to what to say in interviews when the question comes up? My other question is addressing something that a recent potential employer called out. They said they normally wouldn’t consider me because I’ve not been with a job for more than about a year and that that’s a “red flag”. Is this a “red flag” with a lot of employers? Should I address this and if so, how?</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tim Brown is the Type Manager for Adobe Typekit. He joins us this week for a deep dive into web typography.</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p><strong>Q &amp; A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=26:44">26:44</a> I like the Georgia font a lot and have used it for a lot of my designs. Recently I moved to Linux and realized that this font is not shipped by default on Linux. What should I do? I tried to find a web font version of Georgia but didn’t. Maybe I should try to find a web font which looks just as good?</li>
<li><a href="#t=31:02">31:02</a> If you had to build and support a site that caters to 90+ languages, how would you go about figuring out what font stacks you would need for each language? After you figured out that daunting chore how would you implement it?</li>
<li><a href="#t=38:44">38:44</a> I am having some frustrations with fonts. It seems like every time I load up a google font it doesn’t look crisp. I don’t know where else to go for web fonts and for some reason the idea of paying for fonts every month doesn’t sit well with me and I don’t want to try a service without knowing if its good or not. How would you recommend going about finding, selecting, and maybe buying fonts for the web?</li>
<li><a href="#t=51:20">51:20</a> I have a <a href="http://font-combinator.com">small web typography tool</a> where I list all of the fonts from the Google Fonts API. Currently, I have a dropdown menu, with each font listed by name, set <em>in</em> that typeface. So, the requirement is to have a dropdown where individual options can be styled.</li>
<li>You cannot style native &lt;option&gt; elements within a &lt;select&gt;, so I’m currently using a jQuery Library called Chosen (http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/) to produce a stylable drop down. It works by basically hijacking the &lt;select&gt; element and replacing it with a bunch of &lt;div&gt;s.</li>
<li>In my next rev of this tool I’m looking to ditch jQuery altogether (as a learning experience), but am stumped about what to do with the drop downs.</li>
<li>My question to you is: Are you aware of any way to style &lt;option&gt; elements? Are you aware of any vanilla-JS methods of hijacking a &lt;select&gt; menu (the way Chosen does)? Or, do you have any thoughts on how to approach this in a different way altogether? I’m also concerned with accessibility, so I’d like to keep that in mind.</li>
<li><a href="#t=59:30">59:30</a> I remember when I first started learning web design, I took a class at the local community college. My professor said something that I found odd. We were talking about the &lt;link&gt; tag, and including external stylesheets. He mentioned the “text/css” property, and that apparently the W3C foresaw stylesheets that weren’t created as text. I can’t imagine any other way, and I haven’t been able to find anything else about this. I was wondering if you guys might know what this is all about. My professor may’ve been misinformed, but why include the “type,” if there’s only one possible value?</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lara Schenck is an independent web consultant and educator in New York City.</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p><strong>Q &amp; A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=31:57">31:57</a> Hi Lara! I know you work a lot with WordPress. What do you think of the new Layers Site Builder on Envato?</li>
<li><a href="#t=41:10">41:10</a> Hi Lara! It’s Ben, your brother. Hope you’re doing a great job on your Shoptalk show thus far. I’m not sure if you’ve admitted this to anybody, but I will: Lara grew up on a llama farm for the first 18 years of her life with me. Lara, I’d like you to tell everyone what kind of impact the llamas have had on your very successful web design and consulting career.</li>
<li><a href="#t=46:20">46:20</a> In a previous episode there was some talk about how important it is to have a Github profile when searching for jobs. I was wondering if you had any tips on how to build a good Github profile if, like me, you’re not quite the Github type.

Q &#38; A:

31:57 Hi Lara! I know you work a lot with WordPress. What do you think of the new Layers Site Builder on Envato?
41:10 Hi Lara! It’s Ben, your brother. Hope you’re doing a great job on your Shoptalk show thus far. I’m not sure if you’ve admitted this to anybody, but I will: Lara grew up on a llama farm for the first 18 years of her life with me. Lara, I’d like you to tell everyone what kind of impact the llamas have had on your very successful web design and consulting career.
46:20 In a previous episode there was some talk about how important it is to have a Github profile when searching for jobs. I was wondering if you had any tips on how to build a good Github profile if, like me, you’re not quite the Github type. What would you do if your time was limited, but you feel like having a showcase of code on Github is the only way to get noticed by the companies you’d like to work for?

<p><strong>Q &amp; A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=3:19">3:19</a> I’ve noticed that in recent years, more and more Google is doing a good job of cementing a consistent look and feel across all of its products. I was wondering, do you guys think that we would ever seen a HTML/CSS/JS framework from Google? Is there such a framework already that I just don’t know about?</li>
<li><a href="#t=11:15">11:15</a> Eight months ago I quit my job at a startup to freelance on my own, which has been going great. And just six weeks ago, two good friends quit their jobs to join me in forming a 3-man web design/development studio. So, this question is for Dave in regards to your Paravel experience. Do you have any advice, insight or just straight up ramblings about forming and working with a small team of friends and how the three of you got Paravel to a point where you were doing work for high-profile clients like Microsoft?</li>
<li><a href="#t=20:51">20:51</a> I am relatively new to front end design/development. I have recently had my eyes opened to the world of preprocessing. I have dabbled with using Mixture and am now thinking about Gulping it up. Can you summarize the pros and cons of Gulp/Grunt vs Mixture/Codekit?</li>
<li><a href="#t=29:47">29:47</a> I’m an avid conference goer and every now and then, I get the chance to sit down with one or many conference speakers for a drink or lunch, etc. I know for me personally, I don’t always like to talk about work or what I do when I’m trying to relax and enjoy a drink or social event. So the question is: if you are talking with someone you respect, what should the topic of discussion be? Would you want to talk about what devs/designers do in the field or would it be “out of bounds” to talk about more personal things, like family, children, other hobbies, etc? If you mention it in a talk or discussion, is it fair to ask about those things?</li>
<li><a href="#t=34:55">34:55</a> What are your tips for becoming a lifelong blogger?</li>
<li><a href="#t=47:34">47:34</a> What are your thoughts on using Jekyll instead of WordPress for websites where most of the updates will be to something like a listing of events?</li>
<li><a href="#t=51:40">51:40</a> I’m no expert in SEO but I was wondering what are some of the best practices regarding meta tags? It seems nowadays like some tags are redundant, i.e. the keywords tag. What tags do you consider essential to your website?</li>
<li><a href="#t=56:53">56:53</a> I’ve got a quick question about accessibility, more precisely about the ARIA role attributes. So I’ve been using them in web projects for a while now, but only for the main header or main navigation. Can you use one role multiple times on a page for example for a sub-navigation? And what would you recommend in terms of quantity, so what would be a good amount of roles between none and way too many?</li>
<li><a href="#t=1:01:41">1:01:41</a> I was trying to think how to implement the page loading progress bar kinda like the one on Youtube, along with loading the pages with ajax for smoothing the UI, do you guys have any resources for synchronizing these two things?</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiffany Rayside describes herself as a “Highly Idiosyncratic WebDev Hobbyist &amp; CodePen Enthusiast”. We know her best as tmrDevelops on CodePen, where she&#8217;s created some mind-blowing art using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
<p>In this episode, we talk about how she creates her art, and we answer questions about Javascript, Github etiquette, and more.</p>
<p><strong>We talked about (roughly in order):</strong></p>
<p><strong>News’n’Links’n’Drama:</strong></p>

<li><a href="#t=17:45">17:45</a> What do you think about <a href="http://unsucktheweb.com/">Unsuck the Web</a>?</li>

<li><a href="#t=26:58">26:58</a> Our podcast editor, Aaron Dowd, <a href="http://seanwes.com/podcastdude/">started a podcast</a> to help you learn how to podcast.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q &amp; A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=28:21">28:21</a> I work at a company where I sometimes create small Javascript games for social media campaigns. I find it hard to code interactive things that support both mouse events and touch events. I haven’t found any good libraries that can help me with this. Any suggestions?</li>
<li><a href="#t=35:41">35:41</a> How fluent do I need to be at JavaScript before identifying as a Front End Developer?</li>
<li><a href="#t=43:02">43:02</a> I’ve got a question about Github/Open Source etiquette. I built a simple javascript module for creating resizable containers and open sourced it on Github. This is my first legit open source project, and I’ve had a positive response from the community. It’s been fun and rewarding seeing people modify my code and use it in their own projects. That said, I have a pull request that makes some great changes, but it also has some changes that I’d rather omit. Is there a “correct” way to merge PART of their code while still giving them credit?</li>
<li><a href="#t=53:13">53:13</a> I am currently in the navy as an aviation electronics technician. I am separating form the navy and plan to go to jr. college in the fall. Over the years I’ve developed a fascination over A.I./machine learning, however I originally joined the navy to use the G.I. bill to go to school for graphic design / web design. If I learn web design during school, would that knowledge benefit towards skills used for A.I., or would it be time better spent learning the languages needed for A.I.?</li>

		<itunes:summary>Tiffany Rayside describes herself as a “Highly Idiosyncratic WebDev Hobbyist &#38; CodePen Enthusiast”. We know her best as tmrDevelops on CodePen, where she&#8217;s created some mind-blowing art using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
In this episode, we talk about how she creates her art, and we answer questions about Javascript, Github etiquette, and more.
We talked about (roughly in order):
News’n’Links’n’Drama:

17:45 What do you think about Unsuck the Web?
26:41 New Theme Song! Thanks, Chris Taylor!
26:58 Our podcast editor, Aaron Dowd, started a podcast to help you learn how to podcast.

Q &#38; A:

28:21 I work at a company where I sometimes create small Javascript games for social media campaigns. I find it hard to code interactive things that support both mouse events and touch events. I haven’t found any good libraries that can help me with this. Any suggestions?
35:41 How fluent do I need to be at JavaScript before identifying as a Front End Developer?
43:02 I’ve got a question about Github/Open Source etiquette. I built a simple javascript module for creating resizable containers and open sourced it on Github. This is my first legit open source project, and I’ve had a positive response from the community. It’s been fun and rewarding seeing people modify my code and use it in their own projects. That said, I have a pull request that makes some great changes, but it also has some changes that I’d rather omit. Is there a “correct” way to merge PART of their code while still giving them credit?
53:13 I am currently in the navy as an aviation electronics technician. I am separating form the navy and plan to go to jr. college in the fall. Over the years I’ve developed a fascination over A.I./machine learning, however I originally joined the navy to use the G.I. bill to go to school for graphic design / web design. If I learn web design during school, would that knowledge benefit towards skills used for A.I., or would it be time better spent learning the languages needed for A.I.?

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another RAPID-FIRE for you this week; nothing but questions from our dear listeners and answers from your favorite podcast&#8217;s hosts.</p>
<p>We answer questions about hosting client sites pre-launch, CSS animation libraries, dealing with burnout, merge conflicts, deploying WordPress sites, code portfolios, the importance of blogging and where you should publish your content, metrics to consider when re-designing a website, working with WordPress&#8217;s REST API, and more.</p>
<p><strong>We talked about (roughly in order):</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q &amp; A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=3:26">3:26</a> I’m a bit confused about how can a client have remote access to a project during development, before it goes live. Is it a personal server on an old PC, a paid web hosting service, a free web hosting service, a repository (like GitHub) or something else?</li>
<li><a href="#t=11:31">11:31</a> I just started with a new agency where I’m leading the entire team. I’m trying to push doing more CSS3 animations on hover effects and not worrying about supplying older browsers with that animation. The team has used GreenSock.js to handle animations cross browser. I argue that using a library like GreenSock is fine for large complicated animations but hover effects and minor effects we should move to pure css3 and keyframes. Am I going overboard with this thinking or should I back off and let the team continue to use something like GreenSock?</li>
<li><a href="#t=19:25">19:25</a> I have been actively working in some area of the web industry for the last 12 years. Currently 30 years old and have my dream job as a Director for a great company. I have always had times of feeling burnt out and needing to take a break over the years. Now with a young family, house, hobbies etc. I find that these seasons are turning from weeks to months. Any tips on how to break out of the rut? How do you guys continue to stay excited about the industry and furthering your knowledge and skill sets?</li>
<li><a href="#t=25:30">25:30</a> We use git for version control and follow the git flow model, mostly. We’re getting into a bit of a kerfuffle with our compiled CSS. A few developers might be working on the front end, on different branches, with SASS which then compiles to a CSS file. Then BOOM SHAKE THE ROOM, we have a merge conflict. All the .scss files are fine but that compiled and compressed style.css is an abomination. How do you lot deal with this kind of thing? It’s been suggested that we .gitignore style.css and compile on the server when we push the site but I’m against that for some reason or other. Is there a better way?</li>
<li><a href="#t=33:00">33:00</a> How should I handle the wp-config.php file when deploying a WordPress site? I use Beanstalk and I’m working alone. I’m struggling with this because there are essentially three different versions of the wp-config: local, staging and production. Should I put it in .gitignore and just manually create it on the staging and production servers?</li>
<li><a href="#t=36:48">36:48</a> GitHub has always been a standard for developers and having an online code portfolio. However I like CodePen much better and seems to have a great user base. How do you decide which platform to use, or should I focus on platform for code bits? Secondly, for blogging, should I use a platform like CodePen blogs since I have no audience, or should I do my own thing?</li>
<li><a href="#t=44:34">44:34</a> I’m redesigning and reengineering an organization’s website from scratch. I have clear design goals but want to show objective engineering gains as well, what are the best metrics to compare before and after a redesign? Page-size and load time are obvious, but what other ones should I be thinking about?</li>
<li><a href="#t=50:15">50:15</a> How did the trend of photoshopping your face into an astronaut’s helmet start? I see this in a lot of profile pics. I’m considering joining the craze but I’d like to know the full history before jumping in. Is there something that I’m missing?</li>
<li><a href="#t=52:48">52:48</a> I learned web development and templating through WordPress, like many other people. With the coming WordPress REST API, I’m looking to play around and learn another method for front end development that pulls site data from the WordPress REST API’s JSON output, and therefore I don’t have any backend prerequisites. If you could go completely greenfield with no client requirements, what route would you most want to take to learn a new thing?</li>
<li><a href="#t=1:00:43">1:00:43</a> What are your thoughts about how one should effectively serve retina images? I read this old blogpost by Jensen in which he was able to bypass the use of retina.js, cookies, or extra server-side stuff to serve high-res images on Retina screens. What IS the best way and what makes it the best way?</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another RAPID-FIRE for you this week; nothing but HOT question and answer madness.</p>
<p>We answer questions about package management, inline-css, CSS frameworks, code editors, testing, and more!</p>
<p><strong>We talked about (roughly in order):</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q &amp; A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=4:44">4:44</a> Is it my lack of experience, or do the dependencies on Node and Ruby projects regularly break your projects as the gems / packages are updated?</li>
<li><a href="#t=12:56">12:56</a> On show 155 you talked about inline CSS and cases where it might be ok to use. The one case where it&#8217;s useful is when you want a dynamically served image to fill it&#8217;s containing element, while being centered within in it. Case in point: a WordPress Featured image, that acts as the hero image. If that image is inserted inline as a background image on a &lt;figure&gt; or “&lt;div&gt;, you can simply set the style of that element to be background-size: cover, and background-position: center in your style-sheet, and have it fill the container, without relying on any extra JS or CSS transforms to achieve the same effect.</li>
<li><a href="#t=20:22">20:22</a> I&#8217;ve only briefly experimented with CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and 960 Grid, but my cursory evaluations have led mainly to frustration. I like being in complete control of my code, and I like knowing there aren&#8217;t a myriad of classes unknown to me that are affecting the behavior of the elements I&#8217;m trying to work with. It feels like I&#8217;m constantly fighting against the framework to make things behave exactly how I want. It just seems these frameworks are adding a layer of complexity rather than making things simpler. So, my question: am I viewing CSS frameworks incorrectly &#8211; perhaps a more thorough exposure to the framework in use will open my eyes to its usefulness? Or are CSS frameworks just not for me?</li>
<li><a href="#t=30:00">30:00</a> What are your thoughts on https://atom.io/ ? Seems like pretty good editor, even better than sublime.</li>
<li><a href="#t=41:13">41:13</a> I&#8217;m taking a course on HTML5, CSS and JS at my university in Sweden. They have decided that frameworks like Bootstrap are not allowed because of the risk of plagiarism, due to a previous incident where a student bought a complete website and submitted as a final project. As a result they have now banned use of any use of frameworks, including things like jQuery. What are your thoughts on this approach?I think using pure JS takes the joy out of making awesome websites.</li>
<li><a href="#t=47:16">47:16</a> Hey guys, just listening to the latest episode with Bastian Allgeier, maker of the Kirby CMS, which I love. You guys were talking a bit about workflows with Kirby. I use Kirby on my site and just wanted to show off my awesome Kirby workflow:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>I keep the code for my site on Github.</li>
<li>I keep the &#8216;content&#8217; folder in Dropbox.</li>
<li>I install Dropbox on my server.</li>
<li>I use Capistrano to deploy the code from Github to my server, and then have Capistrano create a symlink inside the Kirby CMS folder, pointing to the Dropbox &#8216;content&#8217; folder. <em>BAM</em></li>
</ol>
<p>That way I can mess around with stuff, while keeping my content out of harms way. Also, for creating new content, I use nvALT (using markdown of course) on my Mac, which has a sweet preview panel that you can customize with your own CSS and HTML, so you get a real live preview of your posts with the exact same stylesheets that are on your website.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=50:42">50:42</a> I&#8217;ve recently been trying to write more tests for my web apps. This works well for functions since I can say, “With this input, expect this output.” But what about for user interfaces? What is your approach to making sure that your changes do not mess with the existing UI when working on a team? Any continuous integration tools?</li>

		<itunes:summary>Another RAPID-FIRE for you this week; nothing but HOT question and answer madness.
We answer questions about package management, inline-css, CSS frameworks, code editors, testing, and more!
We talked about (roughly in order):
Q &#38; A:

4:44 Is it my lack of experience, or do the dependencies on Node and Ruby projects regularly break your projects as the gems / packages are updated?
12:56 On show 155 you talked about inline CSS and cases where it might be ok to use. The one case where it&#8217;s useful is when you want a dynamically served image to fill it&#8217;s containing element, while being centered within in it. Case in point: a WordPress Featured image, that acts as the hero image. If that image is inserted inline as a background image on a &#60;figure&#62; or “&#60;div&#62;, you can simply set the style of that element to be background-size: cover, and background-position: center in your style-sheet, and have it fill the container, without relying on any extra JS or CSS transforms to achieve the same effect.
20:22 I&#8217;ve only briefly experimented with CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and 960 Grid, but my cursory evaluations have led mainly to frustration. I like being in complete control of my code, and I like knowing there aren&#8217;t a myriad of classes unknown to me that are affecting the behavior of the elements I&#8217;m trying to work with. It feels like I&#8217;m constantly fighting against the framework to make things behave exactly how I want. It just seems these frameworks are adding a layer of complexity rather than making things simpler. So, my question: am I viewing CSS frameworks incorrectly &#8211; perhaps a more thorough exposure to the framework in use will open my eyes to its usefulness? Or are CSS frameworks just not for me?
30:00 What are your thoughts on https://atom.io/ ? Seems like pretty good editor, even better than sublime.
41:13 I&#8217;m taking a course on HTML5, CSS and JS at my university in Sweden. They have decided that frameworks like Bootstrap are not allowed because of the risk of plagiarism, due to a previous incident where a student bought a complete website and submitted as a final project. As a result they have now banned use of any use of frameworks, including things like jQuery. What are your thoughts on this approach?I think using pure JS takes the joy out of making awesome websites.
47:16 Hey guys, just listening to the latest episode with Bastian Allgeier, maker of the Kirby CMS, which I love. You guys were talking a bit about workflows with Kirby. I use Kirby on my site and just wanted to show off my awesome Kirby workflow:


I keep the code for my site on Github.
I keep the &#8216;content&#8217; folder in Dropbox.
I install Dropbox on my server.
I use Capistrano to deploy the code from Github to my server, and then have Capistrano create a symlink inside the Kirby CMS folder, pointing to the Dropbox &#8216;content&#8217; folder. BAM

That way I can mess around with stuff, while keeping my content out of harms way. Also, for creating new content, I use nvALT (using markdown of course) on my Mac, which has a sweet preview panel that you can customize with your own CSS and HTML, so you get a real live preview of your posts with the exact same stylesheets that are on your website.

50:42 I&#8217;ve recently been trying to write more tests for my web apps. This works well for functions since I can say, “With this input, expect this output.” But what about for user interfaces? What is your approach to making sure that your changes do not mess with the existing UI when working on a team? Any continuous integration tools?

<ul>
<li><a href="#t=22:24">22:24</a> How do you find living and working in New York vs Australia? Do you feel more inspired being in such a tech focused city or does the &#8216;rat race&#8217; burn you out a little? What level of impact has this new environment had on your skill progression?</li>
<li><a href="#t=27:50">27:50</a> Recently I&#8217;ve been seeing homepage CSS Animations that simulate an app or website running &#8211; see bitly.com or venmo.com. In these animations, the text is live text and CSS driven, and NOT a video or a set of JPG images simulating animation. My question is, do people hand code these? or is there some tool I don&#8217;t know about that makes these timeline driven animations easier?</li>
<li><a href="#t=32:38">32:38</a> I&#8217;m a front-end developer and I use a mobile first approach when building websites. When I&#8217;m given the designs for a site to start building I&#8217;m seeing components on the page that have been removed from the mobile design but are there on the desktop / tablet view. I try to explain there has to be a very good reason to remove content on mobile view as each device should have the same experience for the user and it can be very frustrating if content changes depending on what device they are using. Their argument is on the mobile phone, users won&#8217;t want to read posts and it will just make the page longer as everything stacks on top of each other. I explain you don&#8217;t know what users are going to use the site for and people know how to scroll the page. What do you guys think?</li>
<li><a href="#t=40:02">40:02</a> I&#8217;m a 33 year old former self employed photographer trying to break into the web industry. I&#8217;m a completely self taught designer/developer with experiences in HTML, CSS, PHP, WordPress, Rails and Javascript/jQuery. My question is&#8230; How do you stand out in a field with so many talented people without a killer resume as a 33 year old advanced beginner?</li>
<li><a href="#t=44:26">44:26</a> I run the membership system for a national sports organization in Australia. I sometimes get complaints from one particular state about the system being slow, or a certain function not doing what it should. When I try to replicate these issues, I am not able to do so. Do you guys use or know of any tools that allow you to test drive a client&#8217;s computer remotely and run diagnostics on things like internet speed to get a better understanding of what is causing the problem?</li>
<li><a href="#t=52:00">52:00</a> Hey guys so what are your thoughts about this hamburger trend that has become quite popular for the last few years, Facebook already stopped using it as a main button in it&#8217;s app but a lot designers out there still using it even in desktop sites, what you guys think of it?</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ben Callahan is the President of Sparkbox, the founder of the Build Right workshop series, and an author and speaker.</p>
<p><strong>We talked about (roughly in order):</strong></p>
<p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=21:10">21:10</a> I have been working as a front end developer for a design firm. They seem to always want to use templates to start projects with. I&#8217;ve built them a &#8220;starter kit&#8221; to try and ween them off using templates. Am I wrong for trying to do this? Is it better for the client and the entire workflow? Is this something that is common in other design / development firms?</li>
<li><a href="#t=26:30">26:30</a> As we know, Ben co-owns Sparkbox, which means that all 3 of you have made the transition from being a web designer to running your own business. If you could go back and tell your younger, naive self just getting started with running a business one thing, what would that be? Similarly, what advice do you have for ShopTalk listeners who are thinking about moving from just working in the industry to owning or running a business in the industry?</li>
<li><a href="#t=37:48">37:48</a> How do you facilitate communication between designers, developers, managers, and clients at Sparkbox? Do you find projects done in the open (like CodePen) help that relationship through transparency?</li>
<li><a href="#t=44:01">44:01</a> What are your thoughts on t. domains?</li>
<li><a href="#t=47:13">47:13</a> I&#8217;ve been learning web development for 6 months. I have now started looking for remote entry level jobs as I can&#8217;t afford to move out of the city at this time. However I&#8217;m not quite sure if I&#8217;m jumping the gun on my job hunt as I am very young in my learning experience and haven&#8217;t done much. I hear hear many people say &#8220;oh, just one or two decent projects is fine. Your passion is most important.&#8221; I have a lot of passion for this!So my question is: am I looking too soon?</li>
<li><a href="#t=50:20">50:20</a> How can I apply an overlay to an element or to my entire screen that blurs everything &#8220;behind&#8221; it? I am well aware of the filter: blur(xpx) method; however, it is my understanding that that method only works with images. What if I also wanted to blur other things &#8212; such as a nav menu, text, a form, buttons, or really anything OTHER than a simple image? Is this even possible?</li>
<li><a href="#t=53:21">53:21</a> In a world of style guides (Salesforce / Lonely Planet&#8217;s Rizzo / Starbucks / Bootstrap, etc&#8230;), how does the CMS fit into all this? Are there any good examples of style guide usage out there rather than just flat HTML &#8216;lifeless&#8217; pretty looking docs? I&#8217;d love to see a working WordPress style guide.</li>

<p>We answer questions about taking over a web service, if you should focus on building a team or a product first, carousel sliders, the merits of cover letters, grid systems, Flexbox, disruption in the web design industry, and more.</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p><strong>Q &amp; A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=2:51">2:51</a> I have the opportunity to build a &#8220;new and improved&#8221; product for a pre-existing web service, with over 1,000 paying users. The original company has no desire to pursue this product and will share the majority of the profits if we take over operations, so upon launch we will have over a 1,000 customers to convert! But, my business partner thinks we should focus on building a company before the product. What would you focus on first? The company or the product?</li>
<li><a href="#t=11:28">11:28</a> On the show, you reference Owl Carousel quite a bit. This is a great plugin &amp; as worked seamless for my projects. Problem is, I&#8217;m looking for a plugin that don&#8217;t invoke any libraries or jQuery dependancies. Any recommendations?</li>
<li><a href="#t=19:32">19:32</a> What do you guys think about cover letters?</li>
<li><a href="#t=24:15">24:15</a> What are your thoughts on using a typography style sheet partial?</li>
<li><a href="#t=30:52">30:52</a> I&#8217;ve never found much use for grid systems because I prefer to hand code my layouts. Recently I discovered Susy and I&#8217;ve started to change my mind. I&#8217;m curious what you guys think about Susy and what kind of grid system, if any, you use?</li>
<li><a href="#t=38:43">38:43</a> Is thegrid.io going to replace web design?</li>
<li><a href="#t=47:57">47:57</a> What&#8217;s your take on using &#8220;data-ng-value&#8221; (or &#8220;x-ng-value&#8221;) versus just using &#8220;ng-value&#8221; on your markup? The former is better for wc3 validation, but does it matter in the long run if you stick with using the latter? Are there any major repercussions, aside from getting a whole lotta red when validating your HTML5 markup?</li>

		<itunes:summary>We hope you like Rapidfires cause we got another one for you this week!
We answer questions about taking over a web service, if you should focus on building a team or a product first, carousel sliders, the merits of cover letters, grid systems, Flexbox, disruption in the web design industry, and more.
We talked about (roughly in order):
Q &#38; A:

2:51 I have the opportunity to build a &#8220;new and improved&#8221; product for a pre-existing web service, with over 1,000 paying users. The original company has no desire to pursue this product and will share the majority of the profits if we take over operations, so upon launch we will have over a 1,000 customers to convert! But, my business partner thinks we should focus on building a company before the product. What would you focus on first? The company or the product?
11:28 On the show, you reference Owl Carousel quite a bit. This is a great plugin &#38; as worked seamless for my projects. Problem is, I&#8217;m looking for a plugin that don&#8217;t invoke any libraries or jQuery dependancies. Any recommendations?
19:32 What do you guys think about cover letters?
24:15 What are your thoughts on using a typography style sheet partial?
30:52 I&#8217;ve never found much use for grid systems because I prefer to hand code my layouts. Recently I discovered Susy and I&#8217;ve started to change my mind. I&#8217;m curious what you guys think about Susy and what kind of grid system, if any, you use?
38:43 Is thegrid.io going to replace web design?
47:57 What&#8217;s your take on using &#8220;data-ng-value&#8221; (or &#8220;x-ng-value&#8221;) versus just using &#8220;ng-value&#8221; on your markup?

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another RAPID-FIRE for you this week; nothing but HOT question and answer madness.</p>
<p>We answered questions about sidebar layouts, Linux as a dev environment, authentication in rails apps, managing personal and business branding and social media, salaries for junior developers, automated pre-launch testing, and managing WordPress databases. Dave also reveals his secret desire to switch to Windows for a year.</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p><strong>Q &amp; A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=4:08">4:08</a> My question is about empty sidebars on long &#8220;pages&#8221; (trying to get away form using that word). Many websites have a sidebar column floated to one side of the viewport, and once you scroll past the content in the sidebar it&#8217;s empty space. Is there a good fix for this?</li>

		<itunes:summary>Another RAPID-FIRE for you this week; nothing but HOT question and answer madness.
We answered questions about sidebar layouts, Linux as a dev environment, authentication in rails apps, managing personal and business branding and social media, salaries for junior developers, automated pre-launch testing, and managing WordPress databases. Dave also reveals his secret desire to switch to Windows for a year.
We talked about (roughly in order):
Q &#38; A:

4:08 My question is about empty sidebars on long &#8220;pages&#8221; (trying to get away form using that word). Many websites have a sidebar column floated to one side of the viewport, and once you scroll past the content in the sidebar it&#8217;s empty space. Is there a good fix for this?
10:12 It seems that in webdev land, Mac is the king, Windows is a footnote, and Linux is the redheaded step-child that nobody talks about. What do you guys think about Linux as a developer environment?
19:27 So I have this&#8230; uh&#8230; friend&#8230; who&#8217;s building a Rails app and he, I mean she, is wondering about Authentication. Rails has this gem called Devise and there&#8217;s two standard plugins that aren&#8217;t enabled by default: Confirmable and Lockable. Confirmable will send email confirmation to verify accounts. This seems pretty standard right? Lockable will lock out the account after a few failed attempts. Should she enable both of those?
26:32 How do you guys strike a balance between your personal and business brands across all social platforms? How do you decide if a tweet should be from your personal account or business account? When do you cross promote? Do your messages change across platforms? Do you simply repeat the same post on twitter, facebook, google+, etc or do you adjust your message based on the platform?
38:23 What do you think about employers willing to pay $20/hour or less with junior (front-end) developers? Does salary raise any red flags?
42:33 Have you ever used, or know of any existing tools that use JS automation to check things on a pre-launch checklist?
49:44 Is there a point that WP suffers a performance hit due to a large database?

26:17 U.S. Smartphone Use in 2015
1 in 10 Americans “do not have any other form of high-speed internet access at home beyond their phone’s data plan.”
30% of smartphone-dependent Americans “‘frequently’ reach the maximum amount of data [on] their cell phone plan.”

7:58 Nicole, you began your descent into front-end web development while working as web designer right? I&#8217;m curious what steps you took to move from from the canvas to code.
34:32 I have a question about finishing up a project.

47:46 How do you deal with assets in a Github / Jekyll set-up?
55:06 Lately, I&#8217;ve been using the CSS checkbox hack to toggle styles of HTML elements. For example, clicking a menu drop-down or clicking a help icon to display an information popup. Should I use jQuery instead or is it safe to keep these minor interactions in CSS?

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Addy Osmoni is an engineer at Google, where he works on Chrome &amp; Polymer. Addy is also the creator of TodoMVC, @Yeoman, Web Starter Kit, and the author of JavaScript Design Patterns.</p>
<p>He joined us to talk frameworks, performance, JavaScript, and more.</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=15:48">15:48</a> What is the best way for someone to pursue a similar career at Google or elsewhere?</li>
<li><a href="#t=19:44">19:44</a> At what point you make the trade-off between additional bytes of file-size vs. an extra HTTP request. Basically, at what point does the extra HTTP request become worthwhile? 5kb, 10kb, 50kb?</li>
<li><a href="#t=33:55">33:55</a>  I will be rebuilding our website and app dashboard soon, and instead of having a desktop version and a mobile version, I’m going have just 1 version which will support both. I would like to use a different set of js files for the smallest i.e.: mobile version, vs the desktop size or rather anything bigger then the mobile version which in my case would be 320px. I’ve seen examples of people using JavaScript to import script tags, but how would you guys go about this?</li>
<li><a href="#t=40:58">40:58</a> I am so frustrated with the current state of JavaScript. I feel like there are so many libraries and tools that the language is getting over saturated. Because of this over saturation there are now conflicting best practices. For example, if we want to use requireJS and concatenate all of our libraries together, then we cannot use a CDN fallback for those libraries. So, do we do AMD or CDN?</li>
<li><a href="#t=45:35">45:35</a> I’ve recently begun diving into the MEAN stack, and so far, have really enjoyed it. Coming from a LAMP stack background, it&#8217;s been a pretty big huge mindset shift, but the idea of running a server on JavaScript is both too terrifying and too intriguing to pass up. What do you guys think about the MEAN stack?</li>
<li><a href="#t=50:55">50:55</a> As a front and back end developer I often find myself Googling pretty much anything from a CSS to PHP. For example, today I searched for &#8220;SASS Parent Selectors&#8221; and &#8220;Equal height columns in CSS.&#8221; I often think that I&#8217;m just good at searching the web and not so much at development, am I overreacting or do other developers run into this situation?</li>
<li><a href="#t=53:42">53:42</a> Can you explain what &#8220;The tiniest yet most powerful JS utility ever&#8221; is all about?</li>
<li><a href="#t=56:12">56:12</a> The NYTimes is describing some of the technology they used for their re-design. Including a paragraph about responsiveness and breakpoints called &#8216;A smarter layout&#8217;.</li>
</ul>
<p>They decided to go for CSS classes set via JavaScript to switch the layout. So like Modernizr-is-taking-care-of-mediaqueries-ish-kinda-way. What do you think about this approach?</p>

He joined us to talk frameworks, performance, JavaScript, and more.
We talked about (roughly in order):
Q &#38; A:

15:48 What is the best way for someone to pursue a similar career at Google or elsewhere?
19:44 At what point you make the trade-off between additional bytes of file-size vs. an extra HTTP request. Basically, at what point does the extra HTTP request become worthwhile? 5kb, 10kb, 50kb?
33:55  I will be rebuilding our website and app dashboard soon, and instead of having a desktop version and a mobile version, I’m going have just 1 version which will support both. I would like to use a different set of js files for the smallest i.e.: mobile version, vs the desktop size or rather anything bigger then the mobile version which in my case would be 320px. I’ve seen examples of people using JavaScript to import script tags, but how would you guys go about this?
40:58 I am so frustrated with the current state of JavaScript. I feel like there are so many libraries and tools that the language is getting over saturated.

53:42 Can you explain what &#8220;The tiniest yet most powerful JS utility ever&#8221; is all about?
56:12 The NYTimes is describing some of the technology they used for their re-design. Including a paragraph about responsiveness and breakpoints called &#8216;A smarter layout&#8217;.

They decided to go for CSS classes set via JavaScript to switch the layout. So like Modernizr-is-taking-care-of-mediaqueries-ish-kinda-way. What do you think about this approach?

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anna Debenham is a freelance Front-End Developer based in the UK. She started finding clients when she was 18 and never looked back.</p>
<p>In this episode, she shared some great advice about how to get started as a web freelancer. We also discussed handing off projects to clients, working with Flexbox, how to present work to clients remotely, how to come up with awesome job titles for yourself, and more.</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p><strong>Q &amp; A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=17:08">17:08</a> I always wanted to be a contractor, I consider myself a cool (not as cool as Anna Debenham) front end, but I cannot step on the contractor world. Since you work that way, what are your steps to get into it?</li>
<li><a href="#t=22:08">22:08</a> Dave talked about “Tiny bootstraps” for each client. I really like this idea, but am curious what that looks like for you in practice. Do you deliver a folder of sass partials for them to work with, or do you have a minified stylesheet and a style guide with classes that they can use?</li>
<li><a href="#t=31:53">31:53</a> As I was just about to write a small Flexbox grid system, a coworker (let&#8217;s call him Big Time Timmy Jim) showed me this article about how you shouldn&#8217;t use Flexbox for major layout things because paint times drop significantly. The author&#8217;s answer is to use the grid spec, but that&#8217;s pretty far in the future with not much browser support today.What are your thoughts on this?</li>
<li><a href="#t=41:34">41:34</a> I&#8217;ve recently taken the jump to full-time client work and I have a question regarding working remotely. When it comes time to present a concept for a new site how do you prefer to demonstrate it to a client who is hundreds of miles away? I’ve heard of designers using video and web-based prototyping and I’d love to hear what’s worked well for you.</li>
<li><a href="#t=49:41">49:41</a> Is there a place for someone who is both a designer and a front-end developer? How do you describe to a potential employer that you can in fact do both, and want to do both?</li>
<li><a href="#t=55:12">55:12</a> I am from France and I do HTML/CSS and a little JS for a web agency. I do not do the ux and the ui design, my mate Clément does it. I never know if I should say &#8220;front end developer&#8221; (because I don&#8217;t do the development of our web-applications) or &#8220;front end designer&#8221; (because I don&#8217;t ux/ui design). What should I call myself?</li>

20:41 Russell Heimlich built a site for his daughter using the real-time API from Instagram

Q &#38; A:

22:04 I have been looking at the Electric Pulp website and I love the fonts you have used. I am picking fonts for a project in the making and was wondering if there was an efficient way to do this?
26:34 What&#8217;s your opinion on using inline styles?
42:20 Do you know of any resources or places out there where there are people that want a website built by someone who isn&#8217;t a pro?
47:36 How do you deal with a boss that doesn&#8217;t respect his employees&#8217; time and talents?
51:20 How should web designers present their portfolio work in an interview? Should they have a print portfolio like traditional designers, or is showing up with a laptop and clicking through your work online acceptable?
53:59 I&#8217;m a long time developer that recently have started to listen to your show as I&#8217;ve grown more and more interested in the front end part of the development I do. My question is: where do you draw the line between front and back-end developer/work?

<li><a href="#t=25:04">25:04</a> I often read about &#8220;prototyping&#8221; using bootstrap, foundation, etc. Does this mean building a prototype site (with minimum design and code) and after some kind of approval step, then begin building the real project with new code?

10:54 The web isn&#8217;t ready for 60fps

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dan Denney is a front-end dev at Code School and the founder of Front-End Conf.</p>
<p>Dan shared his workflow for sending HTML email, we took a deep dive into Mandrill, discussed our current build processes, how to get a team up to modern development standards, and more.</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p><strong>Q &amp; A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=23:54">23:54</a> What are you using for your build process when developing?</li>
<li><a href="#t=31:49">31:49</a> I work for a large software company and enjoy my work but, we have weekly meetings discussing non-software things. How can I give feedback about these meetings without sounding like a jerk?</li>
<li><a href="#t=40:20">40:20</a> I just landed a gig as a developer at a local marketing agency. From my understanding they have been using back-end developers to develop the front-end of websites. They also use designers with focus in print to create web designs and tackle usability. The designers and developers alike have been resistant to modern web best practices. The phrase &#8220;pixel perfect&#8221; is often used and it is expected that the final product be a mirror image of the mockup. With experience in UX, mobile, and performance I would like to bring them up to speed in the modern era of web development.

		<itunes:summary>Dan Denney is a front-end dev at Code School and the founder of Front-End Conf.
Dan shared his workflow for sending HTML email, we took a deep dive into Mandrill, discussed our current build processes, how to get a team up to modern development standards, and more.
We talked about (roughly in order):
Q &#38; A:

23:54 What are you using for your build process when developing?
31:49 I work for a large software company and enjoy my work but, we have weekly meetings discussing non-software things. How can I give feedback about these meetings without sounding like a jerk?
40:20 I just landed a gig as a developer at a local marketing agency. From my understanding they have been using back-end developers to develop the front-end of websites. They also use designers with focus in print to create web designs and tackle usability. The designers and developers alike have been resistant to modern web best practices. The phrase &#8220;pixel perfect&#8221; is often used and it is expected that the final product be a mirror image of the mockup. With experience in UX, mobile, and performance I would like to bring them up to speed in the modern era of web development. Am I fighting a useless battle or do you have some ideas on how I can relate to the entire team to make a shift?
48:57 I have a question about extending WordPress. My client needs a CRM for his non-profit. Would a system built with custom post types and fields get me far enough along this path, or am I better off suggesting he invest in an existing CRM and find some way to integrate it with WordPress?
57:24 My question concerns the registration form for a web app, which I am currently developing. Should I require the user to verify either their email address or their password, or both?

<p>In this episode, we discuss designing on the Z axis, disruption in the web design industry, responsive design for giant screens, next steps for a junior designer looking to level-up, and more!</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p><strong>News’n’Links’n’Drama:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=19:38">19:38</a> <a href="http://shoptalkshow.com/">Shoptalkshow.com</a> redesign! Fresh! Exciting! It&#8217;ll change your life!</li>
<li><a href="#t=29:29">29:29</a> <a href="https://iojs.org/">io.js</a> reached 1.0</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q &amp; A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=30:56">30:56</a> I have noticed that the :visited selector seems to have fallen in usage over the last few years. Do you think styling :visited links is better or worse for accessibility?</li>
<li><a href="#t=37:00">37:00</a> I am in the process of building a mobile first e-commerce website. At the moment my layout cover screens up to 1600px wide with information, for instance when I display the catalogue, a grid three products wide covers most of the screen. Is this too wide, how wide is too wide, what are your thoughts on responsive web design for larger screens?</li>
<li><a href="#t=42:25">42:25</a> My question is about billing. I do freelance web development and I&#8217;m starting to gain quite a few clients and recurring billing is becoming more important. In the past I&#8217;ve used a google doc template but feel it looks unprofessional and I&#8217;d like to use a software that stores my clients information. What are your suggestions?</li>
<li><a href="#t=46:57">46:57</a> I wanted to ask about how you guys started in the trade and is there any significant steps (tutorials, languages, workflow improvements) that you would recommend?</li>
<li><a href="#t=51:17">51:17</a> When I specify a text size in CSS, it appears in different sizes on iOS devices (iPhones &amp; iPads). It even appears in different sizes on the same device depending on whether it&#8217;s rotated into portrait or landscape view. Please explain the rules used by iOS devices to shrink or enlarge text. Does &#8220;retina&#8221; resolution play into this?</li>
<li><a href="#t=55:08">55:08</a> I am a front-end developer and have been doing contract work for 2 years. I believe I am ready to apply for a full time in-house dev job. I updated my resume and started looking at job listings. I have noticed listings for UI/UX developers / UI/UX designers and Junior Front-End Developers. What are these jobs like? What is a junior developer salary like? What kind of tools are required for these jobs?</li>

In this episode, we discuss designing on the Z axis, disruption in the web design industry, responsive design for giant screens, next steps for a junior designer looking to level-up, and more!
We talked about (roughly in order):
News’n’Links’n’Drama:

19:38 Shoptalkshow.com redesign! Fresh! Exciting! It&#8217;ll change your life!
29:29 io.js reached 1.0

Q &#38; A:

30:56 I have noticed that the :visited selector seems to have fallen in usage over the last few years. Do you think styling :visited links is better or worse for accessibility?
37:00 I am in the process of building a mobile first e-commerce website.

Is this too wide, how wide is too wide, what are your thoughts on responsive web design for larger screens?

In the past I&#8217;ve used a google doc template but feel it looks unprofessional and I&#8217;d like to use a software that stores my clients information. What are your suggestions?
46:57 I wanted to ask about how you guys started in the trade and is there any significant steps (tutorials, languages, workflow improvements) that you would recommend?
51:17 When I specify a text size in CSS, it appears in different sizes on iOS devices (iPhones &#38; iPads). It even appears in different sizes on the same device depending on whether it&#8217;s rotated into portrait or landscape view. Please explain the rules used by iOS devices to shrink or enlarge text. Does &#8220;retina&#8221; resolution play into this?
55:08 I am a front-end developer and have been doing contract work for 2 years. I believe I am ready to apply for a full time in-house dev job. I updated my resume and started looking at job listings. I have noticed listings for UI/UX developers / UI/UX designers and Junior Front-End Developers. What are these jobs like?

<p>We took a deep dive into Ember.js, JavaScript frameworks, and working with open source projects.</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p><strong>Q &amp; A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=16:24">16:24</a> I&#8217;m not so experienced with JavaScript, so I really don&#8217;t quite understand the potential benefits from using a JavaScript Front End Framework. Could you describe it with your own words and give some examples for real-world use cases?</li>
<li><a href="#t=25:45">25:45</a> I&#8217;m thinking about learning a JavaScript framework. So far I&#8217;ve been recommended to look into Angular and Ember. Which one is better?</li>
<li><a href="#t=58:07">58:07</a> How did you get started in open source software? What&#8217;s the best advice you have for encouraging others to get started as well, namely designers, writers, etc?</li>
</ul>

		<itunes:summary>This week we&#8217;re joined by Tom Dale. Tom is a former Apple software engineer who worked on MobileMe and iCloud. He also helped create Ember.js and co-founded Tilde.io with Yehuda Katz.
We took a deep dive into Ember.js, JavaScript frameworks, and working with open source projects.
We talked about (roughly in order):
Q &#38; A:

16:24 I&#8217;m not so experienced with JavaScript, so I really don&#8217;t quite understand the potential benefits from using a JavaScript Front End Framework. Could you describe it with your own words and give some examples for real-world use cases?
25:45 I&#8217;m thinking about learning a JavaScript framework. So far I&#8217;ve been recommended to look into Angular and Ember. Which one is better?
58:07 How did you get started in open source software? What&#8217;s the best advice you have for encouraging others to get started as well, namely designers, writers, etc?

<li><a href="#t=28:32">28:32</a> How do you deal with handling the cache of JS and CSS files when rapidly iterating a design for a client?</li>
<li><a href="#t=31:56">31:56</a> I work for a company and my main responsibility is taking a PSD and converting it into a fully responsive HTML + CSS template. Would Grunt be an appropriate addition to my workflow or is it geared towards JavaScript projects?</li>
<li><a href="#t=39:26">39:26</a> What are your thoughts about supporting browser zoom? Do you have any advice on a good policy to give clients on what&#8217;s covered as a bug if it doesn&#8217;t look right when a user zooms?</li>
<li><a href="#t=45:38">45:38</a> I&#8217;ve been recently learning more about Meteor, but I&#8217;m wondering what are your thoughts on these frameworks. Do you think they are going to replace front-end javascript frameworks (Angular, Backbone, Ember) + server side framework (Rails, Express, Django) or do you think there&#8217;s a reason this separation exists between front-end and back-end?</li>
<li><a href="#t=56:40">56:40</a> How do jQuery Page Loaders work? How can I utilize CSS animations (even SVG at some point) on a page loader? Can you ask jQuery to paint a progress bar for each % of the website it has loaded? Would that slow down the loading?</li>

<li><a href="#t=3:12">3:12</a> I have had to do a bunch of horizontal scrolling sliders for work lately. These &#8220;sliders&#8221; always through me for a loop because I am working off comps I had no part in designing. How do I keep these sliders from freaking out when the browser is resized while they are partially scrolled, and what is the definitive best way to make these from a performance and UX stand point so that I can help our designers make better choices?</li>
<li><a href="#t=10:10">10:10</a> When it comes to responsive web design in WordPress, I find myself using a lot of modules in the WordPress page editor to organize the sites content. Is there an easier way of doing this?</li>
<li><a href="#t=16:30">16:30</a> Have you ever used any prototyping tool like Fireworks or Sketch? If so, what is the best tool you&#8217;ve came across?</li>
<li><a href="#t=22:10">22:10</a> Where should I include the media queries for my responsive design in my CSS files?</li>
<li><a href="#t=30:14">30:14</a> Is there a way to use pure CSS (i.e., no JavaScript) to modify properties of a whole table-column without marking up each individual cell?</li>

<li><a href="#t=45:30">45:30</a> Why are some sites targeted by hackers more than others, especially automated attacks? Do web sites end up on target lists, or are the attacks just random?</li>

How do I keep these sliders from freaking out when the browser is resized while they are partially scrolled, and what is the definitive best way to make these from a performance and UX stand point so that I can help our designers make better choices?

What do you think? Are there other similar solutions you like better?</li>
<li><a href="#t=5:40">5:40</a> I&#8217;m working on a refactor of a site I built a while ago. In that site, I&#8217;m loading a font file just for the logo which seems like it might be unneeded page bloat. My question is: is it worth the time subsetting a font for only the characters I need, or would a better approach be some sort of accessible svg?</li>

<li><a href="#t=24:33">24:33</a> I&#8217;m wondering what your experiences are with hacking attempts and what methods you use to secure your sites and servers; specifically for WordPress sites?</li>
<li><a href="#t=38:01">38:01</a> I recently started to use SVGs instead of an iconfont. However I&#8217;m still struggling with the right technique. What are your thoughts on that?</li>
<li><a href="#t=44:11">44:11</a> I have a situation where people are creating and editing content in Google Docs, then pasting the content over to the CMS. Sometimes Docs behaves and doesn&#8217;t include a bunch of inline styles, sometimes it isn&#8217;t so nice. What is the best/most efficient way to override these inline styles?</li>
<li><a href="#t=51:56">51:56</a> Why isn&#8217;t there a good text editor for OS X ? I&#8217;m so tired of these multi-platform editors like Atom, Sublime, and Brackets. Are there any better options?</li>

<p><strong>Q &amp; A:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=16:16">16:16</a> I&#8217;ve been playing around with requestAnimationFrame in an attempt to create a smoother, more efficient animated ScrollTo effect for various web projects I work on. In some modern browsers, I&#8217;m getting some stuttering at the beginning of or during the animation. Any tips on how to create smoother animations using rAF or relevant resources for this type of problem?</li>
<li><a href="#t=24:08">24:08</a> I wondered if you guys had any good references about animated charts and statistics? I would need to be able to have nice transitions on graphs like the classic google analytics type chart (visit/time) and also other charts like pie charts and so on. What tech would be good for this?</li>
<li><a href="#t=32:54">32:54</a> Do you have a helpful tip on understanding the whole WebSockets &#8216;pub-sub&#8217; concept?</li>
<li><a href="#t=46:00">46:00</a> I am front end web developer with php experience but have never created a native phone application. Would a program like PhoneGap or ionic be a good solution for this problem or would the &#8220;hybrid&#8221; app have performance issues?</li>
<li><a href="#t=53:11">53:11</a> I want to know why Photoshop has become an industry standard when it comes to creating layouts for web design. What are some of the benefits of using Photoshop for layouts?</li>

		<itunes:summary>This week we&#8217;re joined by Rachel Smith. Rachel is currently doing animation/motion design for the web at Active Theory.
We talked about (roughly in order):
Q &#38; A:

16:16 I&#8217;ve been playing around with requestAnimationFrame in an attempt to create a smoother, more efficient animated ScrollTo effect for various web projects I work on. In some modern browsers, I&#8217;m getting some stuttering at the beginning of or during the animation. Any tips on how to create smoother animations using rAF or relevant resources for this type of problem?
24:08 I wondered if you guys had any good references about animated charts and statistics? I would need to be able to have nice transitions on graphs like the classic google analytics type chart (visit/time) and also other charts like pie charts and so on. What tech would be good for this?
32:54 Do you have a helpful tip on understanding the whole WebSockets &#8216;pub-sub&#8217; concept?
46:00 I am front end web developer with php experience but have never created a native phone application. Would a program like PhoneGap or ionic be a good solution for this problem or would the &#8220;hybrid&#8221; app have performance issues?
53:11 I want to know why Photoshop has become an industry standard when it comes to creating layouts for web design. What are some of the benefits of using Photoshop for layouts?

<li><a href="#t=17:56">17:56</a> Do you know of any standard way that accessibility-aware web devs will test whether their ARIA-related efforts have proven successful? Is there some screen-reader or browser-extension of choice (or just your personal recommendation)?</li>
<li><a href="#t=26:00">26:00</a> Our client&#8217;s accessibility consultant is telling them that they must have valid HTML in order to be WCAG 2.0 compliant. Is that true?</li>
<li><a href="#t=30:46">30:46</a> With the prevalence of front-end frameworks like AngularJS, there seems to be a rise in logging in via AJAX instead of a traditional post back. I&#8217;m all for AJAX in almost every case on a web app, but when it comes to login/logout, I feel the perceived load time is much better for a traditional post back. I haven&#8217;t done any A/B testing on this with real users yet, but I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts!</li>
<li><a href="#t=42:19">42:19</a> My question is concerning aria attributes placed on icon fonts, and the accessibility issues that can arise if you use the wrong one. For the past year or so at the agency I work at, we&#8217;ve been using icon fonts and slapping an aria-hidden=&#8221;true&#8221; on all of them. Recently I learned of the aria-label and aria-labelled by attributes. Dave, since you&#8217;re the accessibility master, what&#8217;s the best and/or proper way to use these different attributes?</li>
<li><a href="#t=54:30">54:30</a> What do you guys think about minifying html?</li>

		<itunes:summary>This week we&#8217;re joined by Justin Sainton. Justin founded Zao, Portland’s premier WordPress Agency.

Warning: this episode contains some spookily-scary soundbytes; listener discretion is advised.
We talked about (roughly in order):
Errors and Omissions

19:22 Blurry text after 3D transform? You need to use only 2D transform or hide, request prop, show. Thanks to Matt Lockyer for clearing that up!
20:12 Here&#8217;s that jQuery plugin for &#8216;responsive cropping&#8217;. Dynamically crop images to fill available space without cutting out the image&#8217;s subject. Great for full-screen images. Thanks to Zsolt Pentz for sharing that!

Q &#38; A:

22:06 How much does A/B Testing help in eCommerce, and which tools or plugins do you use to A/B Test?
34:30 I&#8217;m working with someone on a WordPress site to clean it up and install a new theme. Here&#8217;s the problem: they&#8217;ve got hundreds of posts and pages chock full of inline styling&#8230; and there are so many &#60;span&#62;s! It&#8217;s bad. Please tell me there&#8217;s a good way to strip all the cruft from these posts and pages in bulk!
38:20 I was thinking about managing CSS / JS for WordPress (as you guys were talking about recently), and avoiding extra http requests. This plugin (AutoOptimize) may be worth a look.
41:35 I have a question about Bower and WordPress. I installed Codekit 2 and fiddled a little with Bower components, which I haven&#8217;t done before, and I installed WordPress, all good except that the WordPress files are in the bower_components folder.

<ul>
<li><a href="#t=8:16">8:16</a> Is there a reason to use single quotes instead of double quotes when writing HTML?</li>
<li><a href="#t=11:45">11:45</a> I started doing work (with a group of fellow students) for a client 6 months ago, and they keep coming back with more work and changes to the site. I still haven&#8217;t been paid for the original work, and I can&#8217;t keep working for free, but I really need the money (if they ever pay). What should I do?</li>
<li><a href="#t=20:12">20:12</a> I work for an agency that hires a new developer every 9-12 months or so (with 5 currently on staff). Besides resources, what kinds of things can we put in place to not only make that a more seamless transition, but also for us to perform as a more cohesive unit?</li>
<li><a href="#t=26:10">26:10</a> My question is about rendering quality of text when the CSS transform scale is applied to the container. After scale is applied the text looks blurry. I tried using some of the fixes (like text stroke, for example), and it&#8217;s a little better but still not very sharp. Any suggestions?</li>
<li><a href="#t=36:00">36:00</a> What are the latest developments for dealing with the responsive image &#8220;art direction&#8221; problem?</li>
<li><a href="#t=44:59">44:59</a> How do web designers and developers handle the hosting of their own sites and their clients&#8217; sites without it becoming a logistical nightmare?</li>
<li><a href="#t=51:20">51:20</a> The other day I saw a stack overflow question where somebody posted a PSD of a share button their designer had given them, and asked for someone to make it work using pure CSS. What are your thoughts on the ethics of outsourcing to stackoverflow?</li>

11:45 I started doing work (with a group of fellow students) for a client 6 months ago, and they keep coming back with more work and changes to the site.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week it&#8217;s another RAPIDFIRE!!! Nothing but ray guns and hot question and answer madness!</p>
<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=3:26">3:26</a> For responsive menus, do you use a similar plugin on each site, or do you build custom menus for each site? Are there any responsive menu plugins that you would recommend?</li>
<li><a href="#t=11:12">11:12</a> When editing pre-built wordpress templates for a company I work for I often find myself using display:none to get rid of content that the client doesn&#8217;t want on the page. It definitely feels like a dirty fix, what are your thoughts on this?</li>
<li><a href="#t=17:58">17:58</a> I&#8217;m trying to develop a horizontally-scrolling page layout for a website I&#8217;m working on. How would you guys tackle this sort of challenge these days?</li>
<li><a href="#t=25:11">25:11</a> I&#8217;m curious if you&#8217;ve ever been part of a team where you or someone else on the team introduced a technology or process change or maybe like a paradigm shift in how things needed to be done. What were the toughest challenges?</li>
<li><a href="#t=35:25">35:25</a> Stacy K. wins tickets to SASS Summit!</li>
<li><a href="#t=38:47">38:47</a> I need to create an array of arrays of images for my banners. How do I put that together?</li>
<li><a href="#t=45:38">45:38</a> What do you suggest a beginner do in order to continue not only learning but implementing new ideas?</li>
<li><a href="#t=50:08">50:08</a> I&#8217;ve been implementing AJAX on my Rails 4 site with jquery&#8217;s $.load() function and using window.history.pushState() to update url&#8217;s in the browser&#8217;s address form. I am having issues with the page staying the same when I use the back button. The url responds correctly in the address bar, however the page does not go back to it&#8217;s previous state. I&#8217;ve read about a few javascript libraries being able to deal with this. What are y&#8217;all&#8217;s thoughts on the subject?</li>
<li><a href="#t=56:29">56:29</a> We&#8217;re considering moving a WordPress site with a few hundred posts, and growing, over to a static site generator like Jekyll. I&#8217;m wondering, how scalable is it? Is there a limit? Do things slow down?</li>

		<itunes:summary>This week it&#8217;s another RAPIDFIRE!!! Nothing but ray guns and hot question and answer madness!
We talked about (roughly in order):
Q &#38; A:

3:26 For responsive menus, do you use a similar plugin on each site, or do you build custom menus for each site? Are there any responsive menu plugins that you would recommend?
11:12 When editing pre-built wordpress templates for a company I work for I often find myself using display:none to get rid of content that the client doesn&#8217;t want on the page. It definitely feels like a dirty fix, what are your thoughts on this?
17:58 I&#8217;m trying to develop a horizontally-scrolling page layout for a website I&#8217;m working on. How would you guys tackle this sort of challenge these days?
25:11 I&#8217;m curious if you&#8217;ve ever been part of a team where you or someone else on the team introduced a technology or process change or maybe like a paradigm shift in how things needed to be done. What were the toughest challenges?
35:25 Stacy K. wins tickets to SASS Summit!
38:47 I need to create an array of arrays of images for my banners. How do I put that together?
45:38 What do you suggest a beginner do in order to continue not only learning but implementing new ideas?
50:08 I&#8217;ve been implementing AJAX on my Rails 4 site with jquery&#8217;s $.load() function and using window.history.pushState() to update url&#8217;s in the browser&#8217;s address form. I am having issues with the page staying the same when I use the back button. The url responds correctly in the address bar, however the page does not go back to it&#8217;s previous state. I&#8217;ve read about a few javascript libraries being able to deal with this. What are y&#8217;all&#8217;s thoughts on the subject?
56:29 We&#8217;re considering moving a WordPress site with a few hundred posts, and growing, over to a static site generator like Jekyll. I&#8217;m wondering, how scalable is it? Is there a limit? Do things slow down?

I&#8217;ve been looking into integrating Grunt into my workflow but I&#8217;m having trouble finding a good solution to managing the Sass / Compass gems / plugins and the NPM dependencies. It feels like wonky to use bundler and npm, my project has a lot of configuration files it. Is there a better solution?</li>
<li><a href="#t=13:28">13:28</a> Just listened to episode 115 and Codekit looks like an amazing application. I have a question about using it in a Rails project. I think I recall Chris saying that he uses it when working with Rails. Can you explain the workflow for that?</li>
<li><a href="#t=15:20">15:20</a> Since the advent of tablets &amp; smartphones I&#8217;ve noticed that my clients are a lot less concerned about desktop legacy issues i.e. IE. Should designers be a lot more emboldened in advising their clients to ditch IE 6-9 &amp; get them to spend their money &amp; your time on tablet-y smartphone-y goodness?</li>
<li><a href="#t=21:30">21:30</a> I&#8217;m having trouble with setting up Codekit to work with a Drupal Foundation 5 setup. Any advice?</li>
<li><a href="#t=28:36">28:36</a> What is a good way to implement page navigation with following requirements: no page refresh, the pages asynchronously preload, so there&#8217;s not much waiting when navigating, flexibility around loading new pages (for example the new page slides in rather than suddenly replacing the current one). Is Backbone good for this stuff or do I need something more advanced?</li>
<li><a href="#t=36:51">36:51</a> I just started working from home and I&#8217;m searching for some tips about how to setup my workspace. What kind of monitor are you using for coding? Are you using multiple monitors? Are you using an extra ergonomic keyboard/mouse? Do you guys like a standing desk? What kind of chair are you using?</li>
<li><a href="#t=48:27">48:27</a> My websites are getting more and more heavy with images and animations and my bosses / clients are complaining that things are taking to long to load and is not very responsive to user interaction.

<li><a href="#t=44:04">44:04</a> Is there a &#8216;best-practices&#8217; way to direct WordPress to run any CSS and JS from plugins in the footer?</li>

We talked about (roughly in order):
News’n’Links’n’Drama:

12:00 Don&#8217;t call it Standard Markdown

Q &#38; A:

16:07 How do you prefer attaching JavaScript events to elements?
25:58 I am having a hard time finding a way to bridge my methods between front-end javascript and back-end php/mysql. Is there a good way to bridge these technologies?
32:36 Is there a foundry or type designer you rely on to provide consistency, or do you assume the well known ones are all pretty much the same quality? Is there a real incentive to hosting yourself?
44:04 Is there a &#8216;best-practices&#8217; way to direct WordPress to run any CSS and JS from plugins in the footer?
53:10 I have a friend that wants to make a quick buck throwing together sites with Drupal themes. How do you both precisely articulate what is, and what is not “professional” practice?

<li><a href="#t=24:44">24:44</a> There is a growing trend now to switch from Photoshop to Sketch. I have been working in a Windows environment all this time and I have no idea what to do if I got a Sketch document! Should I ask the designers to extract the assets to me and use a JPG as a reference? Should I turn down jobs I am getting that aren&#8217;t in Photoshop till Sketch releases a version that can run in Windows?</li>
<li><a href="#t=33:21">33:21</a> What are your thoughts on the single responsibility principle pertaining to classes in html/css? If you use this principle, do you extend many classes in sass?</li>
<li><a href="#t=42:42">42:42</a> I have seen examples (Chris even did one on css-tricks.com) where you can have audio playing even after changing pages. Is it possible to do this with video in the sidebar?</li>

<li><a href="#t=55:05">55:05</a> I&#8217;m looking at switching my line-height set up from rem width px fallback to unitless. This is for a responsive project, where the support benchmarks have been set pretty far back.

<li><a href="#t=23:44">23:44</a> How do you guys deal with web fonts that render significantly smaller than average?</li>
<li><a href="#t=31:02">31:02</a> What is the current trend for the placement of a form on a page?</li>
<li><a href="#t=39:46">39:46</a> The agency I work with isn&#8217;t happy I&#8217;m using LESS or SASS for front end styles.

		<itunes:summary>This week we were joined by Karolina Szczur. Karolina is a designer, developer and photographer living in Kraków, Poland. She is currently working with the delightful people of &#38;yet.
We talked about (roughly in order):
Q &#38; A:

23:44 How do you guys deal with web fonts that render significantly smaller than average?
31:02 What is the current trend for the placement of a form on a page?
39:46 The agency I work with isn&#8217;t happy I&#8217;m using LESS or SASS for front end styles. They claim the CSS it delivers for the client is too messy, and that we should write straight CSS. Do you have any recommendations for writing cleaner pre-processed code?
47:15 Is it feasible in CSS to have ellipsis applied to multiline text (text in a block, so height is also should be considered), if it starts to overflow?
58:11 I am quite new to web design and I think I could improve on my web presence. It seems that almost all web professionals use Twitter extensively. Why is it such an important tool?

<p>We talked about (roughly in order):</p>
<p>Q &amp; A:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#t=3:45">3:45</a> I need a responsive image solution for a redesign of a website running on the (.NET) Episerver CMS. What responsive image solution would you use under these constraints?</li>
<li><a href="#t=8:18">8:18</a> I&#8217;ve built a whole range of different sites now on WordPress and in each case I&#8217;ve felt that once I push the site live, the load time is sluggish. How do you approach this problem and what kinds of resources are out there to help?</li>
<li><a href="#t=13:50">13:50</a> Any tips for avoiding merge conflicts in the compiled .css file when working in teams? Should I even push compiled CSS to the repository, or should this be one person&#8217;s responsibility?</li>
<li><a href="#t=17:13">17:13</a> What software do you guys recommend when testing websites through a screen reader or text-based browser?</li>
<li><a href="#t=23:11">23:11</a> I&#8217;ve seen a few tutorials online using Adobe Edge Animate to create CSS animations. Is it something that needs to be learned or looked into if I already have working knowledge of CSS3 animations and transforms?</li>
<li><a href="#t=28:15">28:15</a> I am trying to dig into Sass/SCSS, preprocessors and have learned a lot already about using command line with Grunt.js and Compass, but I&#8217;m wondering if CodeKit would just be a simpler and easier thing to learn first?</li>
<li><a href="#t=32:10">32:10</a> What are some best practices when using <code>tabindex</code>?</li>
<li><a href="#t=38:06">38:06</a> Where would you recommend a young web designer start off? Let&#8217;s say they know html and css and are looking to learn more or kick of their career, what would you recommend?</li>
<li><a href="#t=41:10">41:10</a> I know there is a performance hit for every new font that gets loaded, but once I have loaded a font, is there a performance hit based on how much text on the page is being rendered? My boss likes to use the web font for the H tags and then use fallback web safe fonts for body copy, is this necessary?</li>
<li><a href="#t=45:05">45:05</a> I used to use my main email address for all my accounts, and shortly after an attack on a certain famous tech company, I received huge waves of spam that I have been struggling to get rid of. How do you guys handle your email accounts?</li>
<li><a href="#t=49:08">49:08</a> I&#8217;ve got a bone to pick with links and a seemingly odd trend of not adding <code>target="_blank"</code>. My question to you is, &#8220;What&#8217;s up with that?&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="#t=54:00">54:00</a> If you export an adobe illustrator AI file to SVG, you can choose to save the layers as meta data in the SVG file. What&#8217;s even more interesting is you can then target those layers with css and jquery. Essentially you can traverse the Illustrator layer stack in an SVG file and add things like hover events which change the layer color via css. Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://skillzdesign.com/blog/clarifies/building-an-interactive-floor-plan-with-svg-jquery-json-and-wordpress/">tutorial on the subject</a> which goes into greater detail.</li>

17:45 Why do you think it took us so long to start using SVG images in web development?
27:36 I just started fiddling with SVG sprites a bit and the things that I haven&#8217;t figured out yet in my SVG workflow are: removing inline styles from paths, polylines, lines etc, so that I can easily override them in my CSS file, cleaning up empty &#60;g&#62; tags, and in general cleaning up unused stuff, so that the resulted file is as light as possible.

<li><a href="#t=25:44">25:44</a> What is your preference for fixing design breakpoints in responsive designs?</li>

Q &#38; A:

2:01 I follow tons of awesome web developers on Twitter and I learn about all the cool new things. I&#8217;m feeling a little overwhelmed. How do I actually get better at making websites?
8:22 I got an email that contained a countdown timer gif. Do you know how this was accomplished?
15:54 I am working with a site that generates it&#8217;s own short urls and I was wondering about adding to my pages. First of all, what good does it do? Secondly, I also saw . What is the difference, if any, and which should I be using?
25:44 What is your preference for fixing design breakpoints in responsive designs?
33:54 Now that Twitter is cutting off their Javascript engine to the public, how do I pull in tweets from Twitter without having to use the embedded widgets?!
40:02 Why do people avoid using Javascript?
44:44 How do you handle touch screens and responsive design?
52:42 Many mobile first grids/ frameworks I see use predefined breakpoints. Doesn&#8217;t this go against the common rule of designing for the content and not the device? Should I have commonly defined breakpoints then tweak each page accordingly?
